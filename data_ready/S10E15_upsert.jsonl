In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.\nMonica: (shocked) Oh my God!\nGary: What do you, what do you think?\nMonica: I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?\nGary: Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?\nMonica: I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral\nGary: (To Phoebe) I'll see you after work sweetie. (Kisses her.)\nPhoebe: Okay. Bye! \n(Gary exits and Monica rejoins them.)\nPhoebe: So, what movie should we see?\nMonica: (sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!\nPhoebe: What?! Really?!\nMonica: He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!\nPhoebe: I can't believe this!\nChandler: (terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!\nMonica: Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!\nChandler: Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)\nPhoebe: No, but it is fast.

I'll just handle itI'll ask you to talk to him!\nChandler: Me?! Why me?\nPhoebe: Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him aman!\nChandler: I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.\nMonica: That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)\nChandler: (To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.

You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?\nRoss: Are you serious?!\nJoey: Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.\nRoss: Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!\nJoey: Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!\nRachel: (entering) Hey, you guys\nJoey: Hey!\nRachel: Is Monica here?\nJoey and Ross: No.\nRachel: All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.\nRoss: You bought Shawn Cassidy!\nRachel: Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? \nJoey and Ross: Yeah!\nRachel: Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross stares in shock.) Check it out!\n(Joey turns and looks at quite possibly one of the ugliest pets that you can possibly buy on the planet. Rachel has bought herself a hairless cat. Yep, a hairless cat! Joey and Ross start to get sick.)\nRoss: What-what is it?!\nJoey: What the hell is that?!!\nRachel: It's a, it's a cat!\nJoey: That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}\nRachel: Yes it is!\nRoss: Why is it inside out?!\nRachel: Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!\nRoss: How much did you pay for that?\nRachel: Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.\nRoss: Yeah? How much?\nRachel: A thousand bucks.\nRoss: ON A CAT??!!!!\nJoey: It's not a cat!\nRachel: All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!\nRoss: Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}\nJoey: It's not a cat!\nRachel: Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!\n(Rachel goes into the bathroom as the guys continue throwing the ball.)\nRoss: (To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?\nJoey: Uhh, the ball thing.\nRoss: Yeah?\nJoey: Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!\nRoss: Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!\nJoey: Okay!\n(They throw the ball back and forth once.)\nJoey: (catches the ball) Uh-oh.\nRoss: What?\nJoey: I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!\n[Cut to Chandler and Joey's, Ross is seen throwing the ball into the bathroom, presumably where Joey is currently using the facilities.]\nJoey: Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!\nRoss: I know!
