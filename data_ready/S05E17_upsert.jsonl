You know what I mean?\nChandler: Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.\nGary: So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?\nChandler: Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)\nMonica: Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.\nPhoebe: Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.\nGary: Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so\nMonica: You didn't!\nPhoebe: We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!\nMonica: The park huh? A public place.\nGary: Uh-huh.\nMonica: I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)\n[Cut to the Men's room. Chandler is practicing flashing his badge as Monica enters.]\nMonica: Hi Chandler.\nChandler: Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?\nMonica: Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?\nChandler: No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!\nMonica: Come on, we can't let them win!\nChandler: Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!\nMonica: Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!\nChandler: (gasps) So?\nMonica: I feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore.\nChandler: Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?\nMonica: Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?\nChandler: Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.\nMonica: Really?\nChandler: Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)\nMonica: That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.\nChandler: Yeah?\nMonica: Yeah. (They hug.)\nChandler: Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.\nMonica: Did not.\nChandler: Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!\nMonica: Okay, I freaked out a little.\nChandler: Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.\nEnding Credits", "metadata": {"chunk_type": "scene", "season": 5, "episode_number": 17, "episode_id": "S05E17", "episode_title": "THE ONE WITH RACHEL'S INADVERTANT KISS", "scene_number": 16, "scene_id": "S05E17_016", "location": "A restaurant", "scene_description": "Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Gary are on a double date.
