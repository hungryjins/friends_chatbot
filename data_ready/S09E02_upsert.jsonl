Person   named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)\nPhoebe: Look at you all grown up.\nJoey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with   Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.   You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks   aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.\nPhoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you   set me up with someone, and we double date!\nJoey: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?\nPhoebe: Done. Oh good, really?\nJoey: Yeah! \nPhoebe: Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know   who's great? Sandy Poophack. \nJoey: (Laughs) Poophack...

You don't have to move to Tulsa.   You can stay here and keep your job. \nMonica: It's great! How?\nChandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only   have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with   you.\nMonica: So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks   about it.) No.\nChandler: I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?\nMonica: No. I can't be away from you for that long.\nChandler: Really?\nMonica: Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a   different state than you for 208 days out of the year.\nChandler: That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa. \nMonica: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but   if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.\nChandler: Hey, you said that without gagging!\nMonica: I know! (They high-five.) \n[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment]\nRachel: (On the phone) Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too! (Hangs up)\nRoss: (Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!\nRachel: Dr. Wiener. \nRoss: Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning. \nRachel: Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!\nRoss: Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?\nRachel: Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!\nRoss: Well, what was it?\nRachel: Hiccups.\nRoss: Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any   little thing comes up. \nRachel: Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What   are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that   when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?\nRoss: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a   good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.\nRachel: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!\nRoss: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another   doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.\nRachel: What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well?   What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had   that shot.\nRoss: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!   (Walks back into his room.)\nRachel: (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In   a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!\nRoss: (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!\nRachel: Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!\n[Scene: Joey's apartment]\nPhoebe: (Enters) Hey!\nJoey: Hey!\nPhoebe: So how is this for our big double date tonight? (She   is all dressed up)\nJoey: (Realizes that he has forgotten all about the double   date) Oh my God!\nPhoebe: Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for. \nJoey: Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget? \nPhoebe: Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen.   She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this,   but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy. \nJoey: No.\nPhoebe: Come on, give me something. What's his name?\nJoey: Mike.\nPhoebe: Mike? Okay! What's his last name?\nJoey: Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?\nPhoebe: All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant   in a couple hours.\nJoey and Phoebe: (Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves)\nJoey: Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why   couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in   there! \n[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]\nRachel: It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how   do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against   your knee?\nMonica: Excuse me?\nChandler: I know what she's talking about.\nRachel: We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting   sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.\nMonica: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman? \nRachel: Ross said he died. \nMonica: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said   he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.\nRachel: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see   him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.\nMonica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood   therapist.\nChandler: He saw a therapist?\nMonica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just   really freaked him out.\nRachel: Why? What was it?\nMonica: That I was going to eat him.\n[Scene: Central Perk]\n (Joey walks in and looks around. He's trying to find a Mike for Phoebe)\nJoey: MIKE!!!\nMike: Yeah? \nJoey: (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and   sits down with him)\n[Scene: Restaurant]\nMike: I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with   you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I   should be open and taking some risks.\nJoey: Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay?   All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.\nMike: I am Mike.\nJoey: Atta boy!\n (Phoebe and Mary Ellen enter.)\nJoey: Okay, look...\nEveryone: (Ad-lib hellos)\nPhoebe: Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do   you and Joey know each other anyway?\nMike: How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a   nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.\nJoey: (Laughs) From school.\nMike: Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean,   high school.\nPhoebe: Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up   to these days?\nMike: Well, I'm a lawyer.\nJoey: Mike, 'attorney at law'!\nMike: Actually, I just gave up my practice.\nJoey: What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.\nMike: I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I   figured if I don't do this now, I never will.\nPhoebe: Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law   thing, so...\nJoey: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to   Mike.\nMary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.\nJoey: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.\n[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]\n (Monica Enters. Chandler is in the kitchen with his laptop)\nMonica: Hey!\nChandler: Hey!\nMonica: What are you doing?\nChandler: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.\nMonica: That's so sweet. Find anything?\nChandler: Slim Pickings.\nMonica: Nothing, huh?\nChandler: No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant.   They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're   looking for someone to shovel mesquite. \nMonica: 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.\nChandler: 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.\nMonica: Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy,   who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.\nChandler: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming   with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.   'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.\nMonica: (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm   good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been   relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?)   is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this   is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo   (sp?) 'I'll take it!'\n[Scene: Pediatrician's office]\nRachel: Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment   for Emma.\nReceptionist: Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient,   he should be out shortly.\nDr. Gettleman: (To a patient) I think you just have a cold,   it's definitely not Strep.\nRoss: Thanks doctor.\nDr. Gettleman: Would you like a lollypop?\nRoss: You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of   a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!\n[Scene: Restaurant]\nPhoebe: You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have   known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.\nJoey: Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.   Mike hit my mom with a car.\nMike: No, I didn't.\nJoey: That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're   friends again everything's great!\nMary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?\nJoey: Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes   the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)\nMary Ellen: Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.\nMike: 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!\nPhoebe: What?!\nMike: What?!\nJoey: What?!\nPhoebe: Do you not know each other?\nJoey: (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that   we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other.   We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch   you in the face for not being cool?!\nPhoebe: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters   does Joey have?\nMike: (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!\nJoey: What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.)   (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!\nPhoebe: Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?\nJoey: Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.\nMike: I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his   mother with a car.\nPhoebe: (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time   finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and   cute and loose.\nMary Ellen: Hey!\nPhoebe: Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some   guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!\nJoey: Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like   this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!\nPhoebe: I'm out of here (She leaves)\nMike: It was nice meeting you!\nJoey: (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?\nMary Ellen: I'll stay if you can tell me my name.\nJoey: Good night! \n[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]\nChandler: Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got   a lot of packing to do.\nMonica: You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.\nChandler: What?\nMonica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,   Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.\nChandler: How far outside?\nMonica: Manhattan.\nChandler: And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before   you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now   it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job. \nMonica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot   to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nChandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four   days a week'?\nMonica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days   is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see   you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really   if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make   it one day, we've got real problems my friend.\nChandler: I think you should take the job.\nMonica: Really?\nChandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you   start chattering like a monkey.\nMonica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!\n (Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)\nRoss: Hey!\nMonica: How was the pediatrician?\nRachel: Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it   was really, really, really good.\nRoss: You promised you wouldn't say anything.\nRachel: I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!   (To Ross) I don't care!\nMonica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?\nRoss: He's a brilliant diagnostician!\nChandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?\nRachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate   doctor.\nRoss: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's   a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,   he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'\nChandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer   in your touchy?\nRoss: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security   blanket to college!\nChandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!\nRoss: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!\n[Scene: Central Perk]\nMike: Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can   we talk?\nPhoebe: Sure.\nMike: I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm   a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny   guy.\nPhoebe: Why did you go along with that?\nMike: Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't.   And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.\nPhoebe: That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me   about yourself true?\nMike: My name in Mike, and I do play piano.\nPhoebe: Prove it.\nMike: There isn't a piano here.\nPhoebe: That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.\nMike: (Plays 'air piano')\nPhoebe: You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.\nMike: Really?\nPhoebe: Uhuh.\nMike: That's great. What kind of music do you play?\nPhoebe: Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right   now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers. \nMike: Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...\nPhoebe: It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.\nMike: Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you   out?\nJoey: (Walks In)\nPhoebe: (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah,   that would be nice.\nJoey: Look at this. My two best friends!\n (Phoebe and Mike look at him, and he goes over to the counter.)\n[Scene: Pediatrician's office]\nRoss: Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby   with the rash came in after me.\nReceptionist: The doctor will be right with you sir.\nGirl: (Reading a book) Mommy, I can't find Waldo.\nRoss: With the circus? He's behind the elephant.\nWoman: Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books   too?\nRoss: Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.\nSally: Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also   a single parent?\nRoss: I am a single parent.\nSally: It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social   life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?\nRoss: Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the   pediatrician's office.\nNurse: (To Ross) Rossy, we're ready for you.\nRoss: Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come   on Ross jr. It's time to go in.\nBoy: Mommy (He walks over to Sally.)\nGirl: Mommy, what's wrong with that man?\nRoss: Hey, I helped you find Waldo! \n[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]\nRoss: (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.\nMonica: Where have you been?\nRoss: I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was   some guy that freaked everybody out.\nChandler: Well, you got here just in time. I really have   to go buddy.

(They hug)\nChandler: (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the   matter Joe?\nJoey: I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big   leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.\nChandler: Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make   all this easier?\nJoey: Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads   for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)\nChandler: Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!\nPhoebe: Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good   trip! (Slams the door)\nMonica: (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes:   Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you. This   is just something I have to do.\nChandler: I know.\nMonica: I love you so much.\nChandler: I know that too.

You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.\nMonica: (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?\nChandler: (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.\nPhoebe: Okay. (and she walks away)\nChandler: What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?

You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.

I-I'm engaged actually.\nRachel: Oh!\nSandy: Her name is Deliah.\nRachel: Oh, that's pretty.\nRoss: (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?\nSandy: I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.\nRoss: (on a yeah, right tone) Okay.\nSandy: Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... (Ross and Rachel look puzzled) That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in... (points at his heart, but starts to cry before he can finish his sentence.

I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...\nRachel: (she's got that \"yeah, try to say it\" look on her face) Yes?\nRoss: King?\nSandy: I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...

Joey is reading a 'Busty Ladies' magazine when Chandler enters.]\nChandler: Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.\nJoey: Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.\nChandler: (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.\nJoey: I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?\nChandler: Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.\nJoey: Seriously? She actually said that?\nChandler: Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?\nJoey: Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!\nChandler: Yeah!\nJoey: Without that, you just got \"lame with women\".\nChandler: Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)\nMonica: Hi! There you are.\nJoey: (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says \"you're welcome\" without a sound)\n[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe just let David in who brought a bottle of wine.]\nDavid: Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.\nPhoebe: Oof...\nDavid: In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. (David holds Phoebe and wants to kiss her.)\nPhoebe: Oh, wait, wait!\nDavid: Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...\nPhoebe: No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.\nDavid: Oh... oh...\nPhoebe: Yeah, I should have told you.\nDavid: No... well, yeah.\nPhoebe: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\nDavid: Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?\nPhoebe: I am happy.\nDavid: Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...\nPhoebe: Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.\nDavid: Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?\nPhoebe: Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...\nDavid: No... no...\nPhoebe: I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)\nDavid: In Minsk...\nPhoebe: Yeah?\nDavid: ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.\nPhoebe: Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)\n[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Sandy sit on the couch. Sandy holds Emma. Ross enters the apartment. Sandy and Rachel wipe their tears away with handkerchiefs]\nRachel: (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...\nRoss: (very worried) Is everything allright?\nRachel: Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiance and it was just sooo beautiful.\nSandy: Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...\nRachel: I can't... I can't hear it again.\nSandy: You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears again)\nRoss: And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a \"why do you say that\" manner) Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?\nRachel: Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)\nRoss: Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.\nRachel: Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.\nRoss: (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)\nRachel: What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?\nRoss: (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!\nRachel: Sandy made Madeleines.\nRoss: This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)\nRachel: Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.\nRoss: Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.\nRachel: Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)\n[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She and David are still kissing each other in the living room.]\nPhoebe: Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.\nDavid: But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.\nPhoebe: No, no. No.\nDavid: But... ergo...\nPhoebe: Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...\nDavid: Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui... (David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)\nMike: Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't want to believe what's happening)\nPhoebe: (points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen and Ross enters.]\nRoss: Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?\nMonica: Yeah! I think that's great!\nRoss: Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?\nMonica: Oh... How are they?\nRoss: (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)\nJoey: Hey!\nRoss: Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.\nJoey: (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...\nRoss: Thank you!\nJoey: That's like a woman wanting to be a...\nRoss: ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?\nMonica: Yes... What is the end of that sentence?\nJoey: Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?\nMonica: Yeah, so?\nRoss: Wow!\nJoey: Really? Do you not know Chandler?\nMonica: Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...\nJoey: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)\nRoss: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?\nJoey: ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)\nMonica: I can't believe he's that upset about this...\nJoey: Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)\nChandler: Hey!\nJoey: Heeeyy! Hey!\nChandler: What are you guys talking about?\nRoss: Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound like \"Can you believe that?\")\nChandler: You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)\nChandler: You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)\nMonica: Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!\nChandler: If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)\nMonica: Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)\nChandler: What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)\nMonica: Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)\nChandler: Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)\nJoey: Yeah....\nChandler: So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)\nMonica: Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.\nChandler: Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?\nMonica: Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...\nChandler: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.\nMonica: Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.\nRoss: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross \"What are you doing?)\nJoey: Not knowing when to shut up...\nRoss: Yep! That's my thing...\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\n[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. David is still there. Mike closes the door.]\nMike: So... how many guys have your key?\nPhoebe: No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really.

Wh-What are you going to do about it?\nMike: Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it... (he hits David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight using their fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)\nPhoebe: Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you should just go.\nDavid: Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... (points at Mike) well, you just better watch out.\nMike: Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.\nDavid: Oh, you're going to Minsk?\nMike: Well, I might.\nDavid: Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there.\nPhoebe: Okay, well... guys?\nDavid: Right... Goodbye Phoebe.

I liked you the best.\nRachel: (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!\nRoss: Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.\nSandy: No, none at all.
