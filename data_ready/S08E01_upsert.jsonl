Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldve done it all, film, television, and theater.

Yknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.\nRachel: Well, maybe thats, maybe thats really brave.\nMonica: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard its gonna be.\nRachel: Maybe she hasnt really thought it through that well.\nMonica: Well, theres a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize shes not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?\nRachel: (starting to cry) I dont know.\nMonica: Are you okay?\nRachel: Uh-hmm. Im just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.\nWaiter: Champagne?\nRachel: Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did.
