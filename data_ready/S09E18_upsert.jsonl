Chandler and Monica are looking through   some papers.]\nChandler: Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?\nMonica: I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since   I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all   our money?\nChandler: I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.\nMonica: I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than   we're bringing in.\nChandler: Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.\nMonica: Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask   you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know...   finding gold.\nChandler: You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal   out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next   month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's   refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing   soda and beer?\nMonica: Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.\nChandler: No! We're not borrowing money.\nMonica: Why not?\nChandler: Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing   my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool   house... but the other thing was never borrow money.\nMonica: Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.\nChandler: That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through   this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Mike and Phoebe seem to have finished watching   a movie on television.]\nMike: I'm gonna go. (He kisses Phoebe on the cheek)\nPhoebe: Why??\nMike: I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more   clothes.\nPhoebe: Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.\nMike: I put that tube top on as a joke.\nPhoebe: I want you to stay.\nMike: I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers   as I can..\nPhoebe: Why don't you turn them inside ou...\nMike: Done it. (Phoebe becomes a little more subdued) I'll be back in a couple   of hours.\nPhoebe: I'll miss you.\nMike: Me too. (He leaves. A few moments later, he enters again.) You know   what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.\nPhoebe: Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.\nMike: No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and   partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm   there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?\nPhoebe: Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say \"Hell   yeah!\"\nMike: So we're doing it?\nPhoebe: Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! (They embrace and Mike kisses   Phoebe) Oh god, we're really going to move in together!\nMike: Yeah!\nPhoebe: I've always wanted to live with a guy. \"Pick up your socks!\" \"Put   down the toilet seat!\" \"No! We're not having sex anymore!\" It's   gonna be fun!\n[Scene: Joey's apartment. Monica enters.]\nMonica: Hey Joey!\nJoey: Hey!\nMonica: Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never   get back to Chandler.\n(Joey frowns...then looks as if he understands)\nJoey: I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is   my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.\nMonica: (Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's   not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.\nJoey: Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always   a mistake.\nMonica: But Chandler lent you money!\nJoey: And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.\nMonica: Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.\nJoey: Oh...how much?\nMonica: Two thousand dollars?\nJoey: Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?\nMonica: Yeah...\nJoey: That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel enters)\nRachel: Hi you guys!\nJoey & Monica: Hey!\nJoey: Oo...what's in the bag?\nRachel: Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this   place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff   to baby-proof the apartment.\nJoey: Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when   I was a kid it was like.. \"Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!\" or   er.. \"Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!\" Huh!\nMonica: Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?\nRachel: No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)\nJoey: You're gonna do it?\nRachel: Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?\nJoey: Oh, women can. You can't.\nRachel: Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?\nMonica: You're a pig. And you can't do this.\nRachel: Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!\nJoey: The hardware store is right down the street.\nRachel: There is a hardware store right down the street?", "metadata": {"chunk_type": "scene", "season": 9, "episode_number": 18, "episode_id": "S09E18", "episode_title": null, "scene_number": 1, "scene_id": "S09E18_001", "location": "", "scene_description": "", "characters": ["Chandler", "Joey", "Mike", "Monica", "Phoebe", "Rachel", "Transcribed by"], "firestore_path": "/episodes/S09E18/scenes/S09E18_001"}}

Ok, we've got great news.\nMike: Phoebe and I are moving in together.\nMonica, Chandler, Ross: Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!\nPhoebe: I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.\nMonica: Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal   your makeup. Unless they're playing \"This is what my sister would look   like\" (Looks at Chandler)\nChandler: Yeah.... she's not so cute.\nMike: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.\nPhoebe: Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.\nMike: Yes dear.\nMonica: Is that a bit you guys do?\nPhoebe: Uh huh...we're playing you two.\nMonica: We don't do that!

I mean...I'm happy for you guys..\nMonica: I hear wedding bells.\nPhoebe: Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You   know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah.   Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that   highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house   in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send   Sophie and Mike Junior..

Rachel is fiddling with the drawer.]\nRachel: This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater   sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.

Joey sits at the round table]\nChandler: Hey Joe!\nJoey: Hey!\nChandler: Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything   about it.\nJoey: I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.\nChandler: And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica   and I are having a little financial trouble.\nJoey: Yeah, I know.\nChandler: What? What do you mean you know?\nJoey: Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and   the economy is bad.\nChandler: Oh! Right.\nJoey: (to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!\nChandler: Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.\nJoey: Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?\nChandler: Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!

(shrugs)\nChandler: Oh ok.\nJoey: (To himself) I am on fire!\nChandler (Stands up and walks to Joey): Listen...this is really nice. Do you...   (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars?   Did Monica borrow money from you?\nJoey: Err... Kind of.\nChandler: I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?\nJoey: Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems,   it was for something for her.\nChandler: What?\nJoey: Something personal.\nChandler: What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she   wouldn't tell me about?\n(Woman with huge breasts cuts across them. Takes Joey's coffee)\nWoman: Excuse me.\nJoey: Boob job.\nMonica: I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!\nJoey: Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would   be crazy.\n[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe and Mike are packing stuff.]\nMike: Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little \"groomy\" joke.\nPhoebe: Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's   a play on the word roomy.\nMike: I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is...   maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not   expecting a proposal, right?\nPhoebe: Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where   it goes.\nMike: Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.\nPhoebe: What do you mean?\nMike: Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married   again.\nPhoebe: Oh. Wow.\nMike: It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of   lost faith in the whole idea.\nPhoebe: Was it really that bad?\nMike: At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....\nPhoebe: Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with   someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in   the ocean.\nMike: Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time   I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!\nPhoebe: But it's just...\nMike: Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.\nPhoebe: Oh!\nMike: I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together   isn't the best idea.\nPhoebe: No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make   sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start   changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!\nMike: Trust me, I will never...\nPhoebe: Yeah I get that.\n[Scene: Joey's apartment. Rachel is flipping through magazines. Handyman is   installing things. Monica enters.]\nRachel: Hi!\nMonica: So you gave in and decided to call someone?\nRachel: Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.\nHandyman: You're all set. (picks up his bag and starts to leave)\nRachel: Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh wait!   You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)\nHandyman: Thanks.....\n(Chandler enters)\nChandler: Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.\nRachel: Don't look at me I never get his jokes.\nMonica: Thank you?\nChandler: Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing   I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...   single things.\nMonica: Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?\nChandler: No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.\nMonica: Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still   ok.\nChandler: Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.   I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more   specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.\nMonica: Okay...\nChandler: I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would   you? Don't answer that.\n(He leaves)\nRachel: Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.\nMonica: I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?\nRachel: I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?\nMonica: Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting   to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.\nRachel: No you really think that's what it is?\nMonica: You heard him! \"No bigger!\" \"You're perfect!\" \"Just   don't get any bigger!\" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling   coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.\nRachel: Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your   breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose   bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!\n[Scene:Ross's apartment. Phoebe is at the door.]\nPhoebe: Hi\nRoss: Hey!\nPhoebe: Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.\nRoss: Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for   all hanging out but to come to my home!\nPhoebe: No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.\nRoss: Why?\nPhoebe: Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.\nRoss: Never?\nPhoebe: Never.\nRoss: wow, are you still going to move in with him?\nPhoebe: I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really   that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything.   That marriage stinks!\nRoss: Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight   and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.\nPhoebe: That's not how you really feel is it?\nRoss: No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now   but I can't help it. I love marriage.\nPhoebe: Seriously? You divorce-o?\nRoss: If you have to call me name, I prefer \"Ross the Divorcer\".   It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love   to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before   she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.\nPhoebe: It's ok that's how you feel.\nRoss: But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have   so much fun and you love Mike.\nPhoebe: I do love Mike.\nRoss: Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and   you know what? You should be.

Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.\nMonica: Really?

(Phone rings)\nChandler: Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.\nMonica: (On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.\nChandler: Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie!

And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want.

The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.\nRachel: Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail... \nJoey: Make the transfer! (She does so)\nRachel: Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?\nJoey: Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.\n(Emma cries)\nRachel: Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.\nJoey: But he's the same.\nRachel: Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.\nJoey: But he's the same.\nRachel: Joey, come on!\nJoey: He's the same!\n(they exchange Hugsy's).\nJoey: (to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!\n[Scene: Phoebe's apartment.

Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.\n(Someone knocks on the door)\nMonica: Who's that?

I wanted to see him.\nMonica: Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?\nPhoebe: There is a speakerphone on the base unit... \nMonica: Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!\nMike: Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see... \nMonica: (to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!\nMike: Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!\nMonica: Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.\nPhoebe: Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?\nMonica: Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).\nPhoebe: Sit down.\n(Phoebe and Mike sit next to each other)\nMonica: Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!

(looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?\nRoss: uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)\nChandler: Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?\nRoss: Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little \"Ross is dead\" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?\nChandler: No, come on, you know that's not true.\nRoss: What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!\nChandler: Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.\nRoss: I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)\nChandler: Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.\nRoss: You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.\nChandler: Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.\nRoss: Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)\nChandler: Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?\nRoss: No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!\nChandler: Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !\nRoss: oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... \n[Scene: Joey's room: Joey is sitting on his bed reading DooL transcript when Rachel walks in]\nRachel: I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?\nJoey: Original or crappy?\nRachel: Original.\nJoey: No, sorry haven't seen him.\nRachel: Then what's that big lump under your covers?\nJoey: It's Monica, ok?\nRachel: That's not Monica!\nJoey: Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..\nRachel: (to herself) Oh God.\nJoey: ... she's being unreasonable!\nRachel: (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!\nJoey: It does?\nRachel: Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.\nJoey: Really? She... she loves me?\nRachel: Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).\nJoey: Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him.\nRachel: Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!\nJoey: Look forget it forget it...

No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.\nPhoebe: I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?\nMike: It can't be any harder than this...

Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?\nChandler: Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?\nRoss: (sceptical) Yeah... \n(someone knocks on the door) Oh, great.

It is just so sad.\nChandler: I didn't know Ross and you were so close.\nKori: We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.\nChandler: I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.\nKori: I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.\nRoss: (he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!\nKori: You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! (she leaves and slams the door behind her)\nRoss: Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!\nEnding Credits\n[Scene: Ross' apartment]\nRoss: (on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about.

I never get picked!\nChandler: You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.\nJoey: You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!\nChandler: You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.\nRoss: (to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?\n(pause)\nChandler: (looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh ... Mommy?\nRoss: Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel \"Mommy\" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...\nRachel: I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.\nRoss: Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me \"Daddy\" too.\nPhoebe: Oooh, I like that, \"daddy\" (in a sexy tone)\nRoss: I ... I was just talking about Rachel.\nPhoebe: (still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?\nRoss: (tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't.\n(Phone rings, Chandler picks up)\nChandler: Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)\nJoey: Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?\nChandler: Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.\nMonica: Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!\nChandler: He's the boss's son.\nMonica: Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)\nRachel: Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.\nMonica: Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.\nRachel: Ooh, I have another idea!\nMonica: I'm sorry, idea time is over.\nPhoebe: Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?\nMonica: Yeah.\nChandler: What about the ones you have on the nightstand?\nMonica: There are no tickets on the nightstand!\nChandler: Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.\n(Rachel get suspicious)\nMonica: Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!\nChandler: Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!\nMonica: Chandler, sense the tone!!\n(Rachel comes out of their bedroom waving tickets)\nRachel: Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!\n(everyone's shocked)\nMonica: Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.\nPhoebe: Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.\nRoss: I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!\nMonica: Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!\nRoss: 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...\nJoey: I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?\nMonica: When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!\nJoey: (to Ross) I'll show you how.\nRachel: Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your \"special\" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?\nMonica: Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!\nRachel: Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?\nChandler: (to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...\nMonica: Ahhh!  (shocked)\nChandler: Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from Rachel)\nMonica: There's the man I married!!\nRachel: All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!\nMonica: Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!\nRachel: (surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!\nJoey: Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from Rachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!\nRoss: Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.\nPhoebe: Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)\nMonica: No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl) and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!\nJoey: Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)\nChandler: Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!\nRachel: Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)\nJoey: (in pain) Oh!\nPhoebe: (she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!\nRoss: (trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!\nPhoebe: (keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she stops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)\nRachel: Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.\nJoey: No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get jammed in the window)\nPhoebe: If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and makes as to drop the tickets on the street).\nEveryone: NO!!\nPhoebe: Don't come any closer!\nChandler: Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...\nPhoebe: No, what's more important, your friends or money?\nEveryone but Monica: Friends! \nMonica: Money! (they all look at her) Friends...\nPhoebe: Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?\nMonica: They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)...\nRoss: Monica!\nPhoebe: Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I broke your bowl.\nRoss: Go, go, go!!\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.]\n(All are returning from the street after picking up dropped lottery tickets)\nPhoebe: What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.\nMonica: Phoebe, we lost half of them.\nPhoebe: So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I  was gonna win, remember?\nRoss: Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...\nPhoebe: As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish.\nChandler: (looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!\nMonica: Oh, play them!\nChandler: Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)\nMessage: (Phoebe's voice) \"Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise\" (they all turns to look at Phoebe) \"I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo.\"\n(they all keep staring at Phoebe)\nPhoebe: Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.\nSecond message: \"Hey Chandler, it's Charlie\"\nChandler: This is..shhh!\nSecond Message: \"Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want.\"\nMonica: Oh God, I am so sorry honey...\nAll: Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!\nRachel: Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.\nChandler: Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?\nRachel: No, she was just much better at job than me!\nPhoebe: Guys, the drawing is about to start!\nRachel: (To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.\nRoss: Oh yeah, it's a good idea!\nMonica: (she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.\nChandler: Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. (pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?\nMonica: (she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants) 131! (they kiss)\nRoss: (on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel) Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to Rachel)\nRachel: Hi mum, put her back on!\nJoey: (sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.\nTV: \"Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53\"\nChandler: I got that!\nRoss: Oh, we have one too!!\nMonica: We are on a roll, people!!\nRoss: (calling Rachel) Come on!!\nRachel: (on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?\nTV: \"And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7\"\nMonica: Check your numbers! Make me rich!\nRachel: (she goes towards the others and she's very excited) Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!\nAll: Wow!\nJoey: And what did she say?\nRachel: She said \"gleba\"!! (she celebrates)\n(they just look at her for a moment; then they go back to checking the tickets)\nMonica: Make me rich!!\nRachel: (to Ross) Isn't that amazing?\nRoss: Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!\nRachel: Why-why aren't you more excited?\nRoss: Oh, Rach...oh...\"gleba\" is not a word.\nRachel: Oh, but of course it is!\nRoss: Okay, what does it mean?\nRachel: I don't know all the words.\nRoss: I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words (goes back to checking the tickets).\nRoss: Yes you did, gleba is a word!\nRoss: Ok, use it in a sentence.\nRachel: Ok... \"Emma just said gleba\"!\nRoss: It's not a word!\nRachel: Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goes and picks up the dictionary).\nRoss: Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....\n(Rachel glares at him)\nRachel: (searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.\n(Rachel shows Ross the definition on the dictionary, giving him a smug look; then she squints at the dictionary, as though unsure what to make out of it)\nRoss: She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head, very moved)\nJoey: (checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?\nChandler: No.\nPhoebe: I'm still looking through mine...\nMonica: Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!\n(phone rings)\nMonica: (answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.\nChandler: Ah, the \"I'm sorry I rejected you\" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the sofa) Hey, Steve.\nSteve: Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.\nChandler: Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!\nSteve: Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.\nChandler: Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?\nSteve: Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.\nChandler: Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow (hangs up).\n(he idly goes to the sofa, starts browsing a magazine. Everybody stares at him)\nChandler: What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.\nEverybody: (excited) Oh my God, congratulations!\nMonica: Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!\nChandler: Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?\nMonica: You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area)\nJoey: (to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job. \nChandler: Thanks, man.\nJoey: And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.\nChandler: Really? What?\nJoey: Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.\nChandler: (smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.\nJoey: Oh yeah.\nRachel: You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.\nRoss: Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.\nPhoebe: You guys, what was the Powerball number again?\nMonica and Ross: Seven.\nPhoebe: We won.\nRachel: What?\nPhoebe: We won!\nMonica: Let me see!\n(they all jump up excitedly and try to see the ticket)\nPhoebe: Don't tear it.\nRoss: Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.\nPhoebe: I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!\nChandler: Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.\nPhoebe: (still very excited) I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!\nRachel: So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?\nPhoebe: It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.\nMonica: You know what? You can have mine.\nChandler: Me too.\nJoey: Me too.\nRachel: Me too.\n(they all look at Ross)\nRoss: I guess if everybody else is...\nClosing credits", "metadata": {"chunk_type": "scene", "season": 9, "episode_number": 18, "episode_id": "S09E18", "episode_title": null, "scene_number": 10, "scene_id": "S09E18_010", "location": "Monica and Chandler's apartment.

(pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through.\nChandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.\nRoss: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.\nChandler: Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?\nRoss: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!\nChandler: Yes, but the batteries...\n(Ross claps his hands)\nChandler: Thank you, thank you very much!\nRoss: Let's celebrate with some maple candy!\nChandler: No!\nRoss: At least tell me where you hid it.\n[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa]\nRachel: Can I ask you a question?\nMonica: Yeah.\nRachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?\nMonica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.\nRachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.\nMonica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?\nRachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.\nMonica: What do you think brought than on?\nRachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.\nMonica: A love scene? With who?\nRachel: Olivia.\nMonica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.\nRachel: So do you think that my dream means anything?\nMonica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.\nRachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...\nMonica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. \nRachel: You took the same class twice.\nMonica: It was hard!\n(Phoebe comes in)\nPhoebe: Hey!\nRachel and Monica: Hi.\nPhoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.\nMonica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.\nPhoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.\nPhoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).\n(silence)\nRachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...\nPhoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?\nRachel: Ok, we're still on that.\nMonica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough.\nPhoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?\nMonica: Tiny portions?\nPhoebe: Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it\"!\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.\nPhoebe: Well...it's not about quality.\nMonica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.\nPhoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.\nMonica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.\nPhoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?\nMonica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.\nPhoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini?\n[Scene: Hotel's reception]\nReceptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.\nChandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.\n(the receptions is puzzled.

We're way ahead of the game.\n(they make as if to go, but Ross notices something)\nRoss: Oh my god.\nChandler: What?\nRoss: There's something new in the bowl.\nChandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away.\nRoss: No, but I want...I want the pinecones!\nChandler: There's a forest right outside.\nRoss: It's not the same.\nChandler: Ok, go quick!\n(Ross starts stuffing pinecones in the suitcase. As the receptionist walks in, Chandler makes a bird's verse and Ross stops)\nRoss: (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.\n(he picks up the suitcase, which falls open, revealing all the stuff they have taken from the hotel. The receptionist just looks at them.)\nRoss: Oh, my maple candy!\n[Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing]\nPhoebe: (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..\n(Monica comes out)\nMonica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.\nPhoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.\nMonica: Ok, you have to stop playing now.\nPhoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!\nMonica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!\nPhoebe: (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!\nMonica: (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)\nPhoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!\nMonica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).\nPhoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?\nMonica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)\nPhoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).\nMonica: Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)\nPhoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)\nMonica: I'm sorry...\nPhoebe: I'm sorry too... (they hug)\nMonica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner? \nPhoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... \n(Monica seems to take it amiss)\nPhoebe: (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?", "metadata": {"chunk_type": "scene", "season": 9, "episode_number": 18, "episode_id": "S09E18", "episode_title": null, "scene_number": 11, "scene_id": "S09E18_011", "location": "Central Perk.

Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?\nPhoebe: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K.

Joey really knows his art, huh?\nCharlie: Not so much, no.

I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?\nRoss: (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.\nCharlie: Yeah, I guess that's true.\nRoss: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.\nCharlie: He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!\nRoss: That was going to be my next argument.\n(Joey walks in)  \nJoey: Hey!\nRoss: Hey!\nCharlie: Hey!\nJoey: (to Charlie) You're ready?\nCharlie: Yeah, let's go.

Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.\nRoss: So-so what did the doctor say?\nChandler: Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.\nJoey: So you're ruling out surrogacy?\nChandler: Yeah.\nJoey: So, I don't have to learn what that means?\nChandler: Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.\nJoey: Enough said, I'm there for you man.

I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.\nChandler: Yeah, he's better!\nMonica: No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.\nChandler: Really? Are you sure?\nMonica: Yeah, I'm sure.\nChandler: (sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do.

So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.\nJoey: All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.\nRoss: It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!\nOpening credits\n[Scene: Paradise Hotel lounge in Barbados]\nCharlie: Wow!

It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.\nSarah: I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.\nJoey: You don't own a TV?

That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.\nMonica: (to Chandler) See?\nChandler: Yeah, that's the same as \"it has something to do with wind\".\nMonica: Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.\nPhoebe: Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.\n(Everyone looks at her)\nPhoebe: Mike??

(they go outside)\n(Outside the Central Perk)\nMonica: At least you took me down with you!\nPhoebe: I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?\nMonica: I guess, in time.\nPhoebe: Yeah.\nMonica: I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.\nPhoebe: You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!\n[Scene: Inside Central Perk]\nDavid: (to Chandler) Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?\nChandler: I wouldn't read too much into it.\nDavid: Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?\nChandler: David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.\nDavid: Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...\nChandler: Seriously, we're gonna do this?\nDavid: I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?\nChandler: Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?\nDavid: That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!\nChandler: What?\nDavid: Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.\nChandler: I didn't mean now...\nDavid: Why not? It's brilliant! (talking to an imaginary Mike) Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! (pause) well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... (to Chandler) Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.\nChandler: Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.\nDavid: (after a while) How do you think I should propose?\nChandler: David, I'm pretending to read here!!\n[Scene: Joey in his hotel in room in Barbados]\n(Trying on a hat and talking to his own reflection in the mirror)\nJoey: Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!\n(Charlie comes out the bathroom)\nJoey: Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?\nCharlie: (laughing) I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...\nJoey: You really should have been more clear about that!\n(Someone knocks the door, Joey goes to open it and Ross is on the other side)\nRoss: Hey!\nJoey: Hey!\nRoss: (Excited) You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!\nJoey: Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?\nRoss: Yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!\nCharlie: Oh my God! Did you talk to him?\nRoss: Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?\nJoey: You could say: \"Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?\" (looks at Ross matter-of-factly)\nRoss: (to Charlie) Ready to go?\nCharlie: Yeah!\nJoey: Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?\nCharlie: Oh I can't...

Will be romantic.\nJoey: (smiling) Will you wear a thong?\nCharlie: I will if you will.\nJoey: Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!\nRoss: (a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them).\nCharlie: So you'll be ok?\nJoey: Yeah, yeah.

Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie).

Monica scores and laughs)\nMike: Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.\nChandler: (exhausted) Ok, look! Enough is enough!\nMonica: No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!\nChandler: Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!\nMonica: I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!\nChandler: But...\nMonica: Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!\nChandler: What about the obsessive cleaning?\nMonica: That's just good sense!\n(they start playing again; suddenly Monica hits the table with her hand)\nMonica: (in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)\nChandler: You ok?\nMonica: No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause) Oh my God! I can't play!\nMike: So you forfeit?\nPhoebe: Mike wins?\nMonica: I can't believe it! (pause) I lost!\nChandler: No, you didn't.\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Because I'm gonna play for ya.\nPhoebe: You can't do that!\nMike: Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.\nPhoebe: Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.\nMonica: (to Chandler) Honey, you don't have to do this.\nChandler: (In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.\nMonica: But... you suck!\nChandler: (Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart.\n(Chandler prepares to play)\nChandler: All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.\nMike: Ok!\n(They start playing and Chandler does not suck at all)\nMonica: Oh my God! You're good!\nPhoebe: It's like watching porn!\n(Chandler scores and wins the match)\nChandler: And that's... how... it's done!\nMonica: (to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike) loser! (back to Chandler) When did you stop sucking?\nChandler: I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!\nMonica: Why?\nChandler: I don't know.\nMonica: This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!\nChandler: That's why!\n[Scene: Hotel's bar. Ross is running to Charlie trying not to be seen with two cocktails in his hands. She's hidden behind a huge plant]\nCharlie: Thanks!\nRoss: Hi.\nCharlie: Are they still looking for us?\nRoss: Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know, we as a group are not the coolest.\n(Three paleontologists walk by and Ross hugs Charlie trying not to be seen)\nRoss: I don't think they saw us.\nCharlie: I don't think they did.\n(They realize that they are hugging closely and he draws back)\nCharlie: Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... (pause) There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.\nRoss: (apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?\nCharlie: I think you know.\nRoss: I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...\n(Charlie kisses Ross, they stop for a moment and then he kisses her back)\nRoss: I'm sorry... we... we can't.\nCharlie: All right, all right.\nRoss: I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)\n(Joey walks in and sees Ross and Charlie kissing. He gives a faint, rueful smile, then he seems to recollect something and suddenly he moves back to Rachel's room. He knocks on her door and she opens)\nRachel: What?\n(Joey says nothing, but enters the room and kisses her. They are kissing passionately only to stop for a brief \"oh\" from Rachel. They continue their passionate kiss and Joey closes the door with his foot and it shuts in the camera's \"face\".
