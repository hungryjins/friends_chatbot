I officially give up.\nRachel: Thank God.\nMonica: I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.\n[Cut to Chandler and Joeys, Joey and Phoebe are watching TV. The TV is turning off and on, and each time Phoebe is blinking her eyes like the Genie did. The switch obviously controls the outlet which the TV is plugged into.]\nPhoebe: See? Im doing it.
