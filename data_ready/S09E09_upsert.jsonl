The scene starts where we took off in the last episode with Ross seeing Joey and Rachel kissing. Rosss tares at them.]\nJoey: Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see  that, but.. Let me explain, okay?\nRachel: We weren't doing anything!\nJoey: Rach, he just saw us.\nRachel: Shhh.\nJoey: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.\nRachel: No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.\nJoey (to Rachel): Dude, chill! (to Ross) Okay, we also kissed in  Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.\nRachel: Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.\nJoey: Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it  ever happened, but..\nRachel: We feel so terrible about this, Ross.\nJoey: Yeah, but it did happen, so...\n(Ross looks shocked and says nothing.)\nJoey: Ross?\nRachel: Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?\n OPENING CREDITS\n   [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Continued from earlier.]\nRachel: Ross, say something. Anything.\nRoss: So you two are..?\nJoey and Rachel: Yeah.\nRoss: And have you .. ed?\nJoey: No, no, no!\nRachel: No, no, no!\nRoss: But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?\nJoey: Probably.\n(Rachel looks at him.)\nJoey: No, no!\nRachel: Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.  You have every right to go nuts.\nRoss: I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?\nRachel: No, but you know what I mean.\nRoss: Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  (Squeaky.) I'm fine!\nJoey: Really?\nRoss: Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know  why   it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice)  I'm fine.   I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys  kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.\nJoey: Ross..\nRoss: It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what   we should do?\nRachel: Calm ourselves?\nRoss: No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.   I'll cook!!\nJoey: Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?\nRoss: Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if   someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms   off.)\nJoey: I do like fajitas.\n   [Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Chandler are there. They have lots of   brochures about adoption in front of them.]\nMonica: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's   inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways   to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.\nChandler: There's a hair in my coffee.\n(Phoebe enters.)\nPhoebe: Hey guys!\nMonica: Hey.\nPhoebe: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with   the triplets.\nChandler: You know, it's funny. Every time you say \"triplets,\" I   immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.\n(Monica glares at him.)\nMonica: That's sweet. Drink your hair.\nPhoebe: Hey, what's all this stuff?\nMonica: Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.\nPhoebe: Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!\nMonica: That's not really how it works.\nPhoebe: Oh, how does it work?\nMonica: I don't know!\nPhoebe: Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my   friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help   you.\nMonica: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be   great?\n(Chandler looks like he did the time he swallowed the toy in 605 TOW   Joey's Porsche. It's the hair in his coffee.)\n(Frank Jr. and the triplets enter.)\nFrank Jr.: Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about.   When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.\n(The triplets scream and run amok in the coffeehouse.)\nFrank Jr.: That's not what we talked about!!\nPhoebe: Hey!\nFrank Jr.: Hey.\nPhoebe: Good to see you.\nFrank Jr.: Good to see you, too.\nMonica: Hi Frank.\nFrank Jr.: Hi, how you doin'?\nMonica: Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!\n(Little Chandler is pulling Chandler's sweater, while Leslie is   throwing bagels at him.)\nMonica: Which one is which again?\nFrank Jr.: Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the   lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's   Leslie throwing bagels at him.\nMonica (reads a form in her lap): \"Willing to adopt triplets?\" No!\n   [Scene: The hallway in Ross's building. Joey and Rachel are on their   way to Ross's dinner.]\nJoey: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's   cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our   first date.\nRachel: Well, what would we be doing?\nJoey: I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy   dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...\nRachel: Feel me up?\nJoey: In a carriage!\n(Charlie walks up to them.)\nJoey: Hey, Charlie!\nRachel: Hey.\nCharlie: Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?\nRachel: Oh, you bet.\n(Joey sees that she's carrying a small red bag.)\nJoey: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?\nCharlie: Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.\nJoey: Oh. Oh, thanks.\nCharlie: And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you   want.\nJoey: Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..\n(They enter Ross's apartment. Ross is already quite hyper.)\nRoss: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey.   (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new   girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He   squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.\nRachel: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.\nRoss: Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what   did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)\nJoey: Uh, actually, that's..\nRoss: Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these   things!!\nCharlie: Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...\nRoss: What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you?   You see? Who else is fine?\nJoey: Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe   have a drink.\nRoss: You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a   pitcher of Margaritas.\n(Does a Mexican dancing-thing before going to the kitchen.)\n   [Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there.   The triplets are now sleeping on top of each other on the couch.]\nPhoebe: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.\nFrank Jr.: Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you   know it, they're gonna be awake again.\nPhoebe: Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.\nFrank Jr.: Yeah.\nPhoebe: Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest   thing..\nFrank Jr.: I haven't slept in four years!\nPhoebe: That's a, that's a long time.\nFrank Jr.: You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so   many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold   one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with   his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's   three of them, Phoebe, three!\nPhoebe: Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out   of my area.\nFrank Jr.: Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it,   it's too horrible. No.\nPhoebe: What?\nFrank Jr.: No, I can't.\nPhoebe: Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I   didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!\nFrank Jr.: Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking   that, you know, maybe you could take one.\nPhoebe: What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?\n   [Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler and Monica enter.]\nMonica: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great   things about you guys.\nColleen: Oh, please, we're happy to help.\nBill: We went through the same thing when we were adopting.\nChandler: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this   room, huh?\n(Bill and Colleen look shocked.)\nChandler: I mean, you have a lovely home.\nMonica: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.\nColleen: Well, actually, I think this might help.\n(She gives Monica a big binder that's perfectly in order.)\nColleen: It's pretty much all the information you need.\nMonica: Oh my god!\nColleen: Everything is broken down into categories, and then   cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms   in the back.\nMonica: Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.\nBill: I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.   Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.\nChandler: That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?\n(Monica looks at him.)\nChandler: You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?\nMonica: It's.. It's just so pretty and white.\nColleen: The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.\n(Chandler leaves.)\nColleen: I would have told him to do it too.\nMonica: Can I adopt you?\n(Cut to the hall. Owen is wearing his scout-uniform and is looking   through a box when Chandler walks up to him.)\nChandler: Hey, you must be Owen.\nOwen: Yeah.\nChandler: I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.\nOwen: You were?\nChandler: Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.\nOwen: Huh?\nChandler: You know how to use a compass?\nOwen: I have a badge in it.\nChandler: You do? That's fantastic!\nOwen: You wanna see it?\nChandler: I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your   parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.\nOwen: What?!?\nChandler: What?\nOwen: I'm adopted?\n(Chandler tries to come up with a good answer.)\nChandler: I got nothing.\n   [Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is totally wasted, but he's still   drinking all the margaritas.]\nRoss: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second   batch is gooooood.\nRachel: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.\nRoss: Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us.   Just hangin'.\nJoey: Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?\nRoss: I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us.   There's no weirdness, no tension.\nRachel: No awareness.\nRoss: We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh!   Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?\n(The oven timer pings in the kitchen.)\nRoss: My fajitas!!\n(He runs off to the kitchen.)\nRachel: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a   little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he   normally doesn't drink like this.\nCharlie: Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging   alcoholic.\n(Joey and Rachel don't know how to respond to that.)\nCharlie: Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?\n(Ross enters carrying a frying pan with fajitas - without any oven   mitts.)\nRoss: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!\nRachel: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!\n(Ross laughs.)\nRoss: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!\n   [Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there.   Continued from earlier.]\nPhoebe: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me   taking one of your kids, can we?\nFrank Jr.: No, of course we're not.\nPhoebe: Insane.\nFrank Jr.: I know.\nPhoebe: Alice would never go for it, right?\nFrank Jr.: Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've   got her onboard.\nPhoebe: Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know,   hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?\nFrank Jr.: Huh.\nPhoebe: Frank Jr.Jr.?\nFrank Jr.: Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know,   he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.\nPhoebe: Uh-huh.\nFrank Jr.: What's green and says \"hey, I'm a frog\"? A talking frog!   (Laughs.) Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.\nPhoebe: Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?\nFrank Jr.: Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that   knows how to burp the alphabet.\nPhoebe: Alright, so that leaves Chandler.\nFrank Jr.: Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my   little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a   realtor..\nPhoebe: Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.\nFrank Jr.: Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I   can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but   they're my babies.\nPhoebe: I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You   know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You   name the day, and I'll be there.\nFrank Jr.: How about tomorrow?\nPhoebe: Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff   around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day   together.\nFrank Jr.: You'd do that for us?\nPhoebe: Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.\nFrank Jr. (looks at the triplets): Look at them! Aw. I love you so   much. (Strokes Leslie's hair, and she moves a little.) Oh crap, don't   wake up, don't wake up!\n   [Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler comes running into the   living room. Monica is the only one there.]\nChandler: Where are Bill and Colleen?\nMonica: They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you   believe how nice they are?\nChandler: We have to leave!!\nMonica: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?\nChandler: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way,   and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may   have told him.\nMonica: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace   everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!\n(Bill and Colleen enter.)\nColleen: Hey.\nBill: Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the   sour worms. Those are for Owen.\nColleen: I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we   haven't told him he's adopted yet.\nChandler: But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he   already knows?\n(Owen comes running in.)\nOwen: I'm adopted?!\nChandler: See? Intuitive!\nBill: What? Where did you hear that?\nOwen: He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.\nChandler: Which technically now you should give back!\nColleen: You told him he's adopted?\nChandler: I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or   something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the   door. \"Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa   is real.\"\nOwen: He isn't?!\nChandler (to Monica): We have to get out of here, baby!\n   [Scene: Ross's apartment. Rachel, Joey and Charlie are eating fajitas   when Ross enters from the kitchen.]\nRoss: Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.\nRachel: Ooy.\nRoss: And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is   life without love?\nRachel: Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?\nRoss: O is for \"oh, wow!\" The V is for this very surprising turn   of   events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely   normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might   get married and have children of your own.\n(Ross chokes up and pauses. Rachel and Joey look at him.)\nJoey: Dude, are you okay?\nRoss: Totally.\nRachel: Ross, you don't seem okay.\nRoss (on the verge of tears): I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of   entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.\nCharlie: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.\nRoss: No!\nCharlie: I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but   this has been lovely.\nRoss: Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and   that you never really liked Rachel.\nCharlie: You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?\nRoss: Okay.\nCharlie: Alright.\n(Ross goes to the kitchen.)\nCharlie: God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..\nRachel: Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.\nCharlie: Bye.\n(Ross enters from the kitchen with three plates with flan.)\nRoss: Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!\nRachel: You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.\nRoss: Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple   now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.\nRachel: No, no, it's just that it's getting late...\nRoss: Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of   margaritas. It's all good.\n(The oven timer pings again.)\nRoss: I don't even know what that's for.\n(He goes back to the kitchen.)\nJoey: You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's   okay.\nRachel: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.\nJoey: Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.\nRachel: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever   gonna be okay with this.\nJoey: It doesn't look good, does it?\n(They kiss each other on the cheek, and Rachel leaves.)\n   [Scene: Ross's apartment the next morning. Ross is very hung-over on   the couch as Joey enters with a cup of coffee for him.]\nJoey: Morning. Here you go.\nRoss: Thanks. Did you stay here all night?\nJoey: Yeah.\nRoss: So you took off my pants and shoes?\nJoey: No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the   Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you   don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.\nRoss: What do you mean?\nJoey: Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do   anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..\nRoss: Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!\nJoey: It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're   not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.\nRoss: Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six   years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?\nJoey: That's what I hear, yeah.\nRoss: This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys   aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is   this thing with you and Rachel?\nJoey: Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...\nRoss: Joey.\nJoey: I'm crazy about her.\nRoss: And she feels the same way?\nJoey: I think so.\nRoss: Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.\nJoey: Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.\nRoss: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie,   right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't   see the dance, did she?\nJoey: No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure   about this?\nRoss: Yeah, I'm sure.\nJoey: And we're okay?\n(Ross smiles and holds up his hand for a high-five, but he has   forgotten about his burnt hands. He gasps in pain as Joey grabs his   hand.)\n ENDING CREDITS\n   [Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Chandler enter to find Phoebe there   with the triplets.]\nMonica: Hey, Phoebs\nPhoebe: Hey.\nMonica: Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate   us.\nChandler: Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.\nMonica: What?\nPhoebe: Still, he had to find out sometime.\nChandler: Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets   that you gave birth to them?\n(The triplets stare at him.)\nChandler: I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.

I know exactly what I'm gonna do!\nChandler: Really? Like you have a routine?\nJoey: No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have   to appreciate their uniqueness.\nChandler: Really?\nJoey: No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.   Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.\nChandler: You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh   in a funny and awkard way)\nJoey: NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts   lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)\nChandler: Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.

Here's their card.\nRoss: Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this   place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he   is saying) florist.

She's the worst!\nChandler: Who's Amanda?\nMonica: She's this girl who used to live   in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up   this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda   using an awful British accent) \"Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!\"\nChandler: Are you trying to do a British accent?\nMonica: (pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets   pedicures!\nChandler: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?\nPhoebe: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on   the phone?

Just ignore her calls and   dodge her 'till she gets the point!\nMonica: Oh, I guess we could try that, but...   it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?\nChandler: No, had it done to me though. Feels good ! \n[Scene: At the tanning salon. Ross and a male assistant are   walking through a hall]\nRoss: Well... I like how you look, what are you?\nAssistant: Puerto Rican.\nRoss: Two, I think a two.\nAssistant: You've got to face the red light.   When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes.   When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks   then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?\nRoss: Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.\nAssistant: Wow, you catch on quick.\nRoss: Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not   impressed by this statement)   (Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. He stands up   in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)\nRoss: One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer   starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've   not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)\nRoss: You sprayed my front twice!\nAssistant: You've never turned? \nRoss: No, I barely even   got to three Mississippi. \nAssistant: Mississippi? I said count to   five'!\nRoss: Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how   bad is it?\nAssistant: Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps   getting darker for the next four hours.\nRoss: So, how dark is it   gonna get?\nAssistant: You got sprayed with two two'   s and...\nRoss: I'm a four?\nAssistant: Yeah, but you're back's a zero.   You're gonna wanna even that out.\nRoss: (sarcastically) Really!\nAssistant: You might wanna get back in there.\nRoss: (annoyed) Ok!\n(The assistant leaves and Ross goes back in the spray-on tan booth and turns   his back to the spray nozzles, facing the back wall)\nRoss: Wait, wait a minute, there's no light   on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns   and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns   again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah!

I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.\nJoey: Ok.\n(They start kissing again and when Joey grazes, she slaps him three times,   on the hand, and on both cheeks)\nJoey: (a little giddy) Uh, was that good for you? \n[Scene: Monicas apartment. Monica and Phoebe are reading   magazines when the phone rings and Phoebe reaches to pick it up]\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could   baby-sit again.\nMonica: It could be Amanda!\nPhoebe: Oh, youre right! I was just kidding about   Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!\n(The machine picks up the phone)\nAmanda: Hello Monica. Its Amanda calling again. I   am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!\nMonica: You're from Yonkers! Your last name   is Buffo-Martisis!\nAmanda: Lets see.. to assure you get this directly,   ring me back on my mobile.\nPhoebe: Ok, dont hold thy breath!\n(Sound of dialing numbers is heard from the speaker of the machine)\nChandler: Hello? Is someone on the line?\nAmanda: Yes, I was looking for Monica.\nChandler: Hang on, shes right here. (he enters the   living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.\nMonica: We werent picking up, its   Amanda!\nChandler: (to Amanda) I get pedicures!\nMonica: Hi Amanda! Actually now... its...   is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe   and I will see you then!\nPhoebe: Why, why, why didnt you just say no!\nMonica: Well, I said 'no' to her coming   over now! I couldnt say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to   please people!\nPhoebe: (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well   under torture!\nMonica: And you would?\nPhoebe: I did! \n[scene: Joeys apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting   on the couch]\nRachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... its just a   little weird, its you, and its me, it's just gonna take some   getting used to.\nJoey: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?\nRachel: Ok, lets work from the top down! (Joey nods,   but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!\nJoey: Ok, yeah, got it.\nRachel and Joey: Okay.\n(They start kissing and Joey starts to undo her bra, but fails completely)\nJoey: This thing welded shut?!\nRachel: Okay.\nJoey: All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this   thing.\nRachel: Oh!\n(Joey starts trying to undo her bra, but it wont go.The elastic band   snaps back, hurting Rachel.)\nRachel: Ow!\nJoey: Sorry!\nRachel: Well this is romantic!\nJoey: I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me   before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can   do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!   I blame your bra!\nRachel: Its a standard issue bra clasp!\nJoey: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me   off with all your slapping!\nRachel: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,   but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take   off my bra?\nJoey: (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said)   NAH! I don't have another level!!  \n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]\n Chandler: Hold on! There is something different.\nRoss: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.\nChandler: Was that place... The Sun?\nRoss: Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler   and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,   where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)\nChandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory   all by yourself!\nMonica: How could you mess this up? It's   so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!\nRoss: (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?\nMonica: One Two Three...\nRoss: (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel   just enters, sees him and starts laughing)\nRachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!\nRoss: (Still yelling) I Know!\nRachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?\nChandler: How was your date with Joey?\nRachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,   and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and   I kept slapping it away!\nChandler: You didn't like that?\nRachel: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out   too! He couldn't even undo my bra!\nMonica: Wow, really? One time he just looked   at my bra and it popped open.\n(Chandler starts looking at her bra)\nRachel: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have   kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere   and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.\nMonica: Well, you guys have been friends   forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?   You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.\nRachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true,   we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna   power through!\n(Joey walks in)\nJoey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points   to the hall).\nRachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through   (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).\n(Chandler resumes staring at Monica's bra)\nMonica: (sees what he is doing) Chandler,   stop! It is not going to pop open!\nChandler: (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't   know! (Monica just smiles) \n[Scene: Central Perk.]\nMonica: Hey Phoebe!\nPhoebe: Hey!\nMonica: Is Amanda here yet?\nPhoebe: No.\nMonica: (sits down) Oh good. Good, look   I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.   Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.\nPhoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both   out of here?\nMonica: Well, what do you think of Mike   and Chandler being in a car accident?\nPhoebe: (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!\n(A blonde woman walks in. Supposedly Amanda)\nPhoebe: Hi!\nMonica: Hi!\nAmanda: Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug)\nAmanda: (To Monica) Hello!\n(Monica holds her hands out for a hug, but instead of hugging her, Amanda   hangs her purse on one of Monica's extended arms.)\nAmanda: (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you!   Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as   well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch   my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places   them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to   sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!\nMonica: (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is   Chandler and...\nAmanda: (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's   not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!\n(Monica looks shocked)\nPhoebe: Musty!\nAmanda: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like   old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!\nMonica: When were we not friends?\nAmanda: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was   the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).\nMonica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992.\nAmanda: (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging   her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her. \nMonica: (To Phoebe) You were going to cut   me out?\nPhoebe: Well...kinda.\nMonica: Oh My God!\nAmanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like   a perfect arse!\nPhoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an \"ass\".\n(Monica's mobile starts ringing. She picks it up.)\nMonica: (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler,   what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more)   Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry,   but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)\nPhoebe: (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my   God. Was Mike with him?\nMonica: Nope! (She turns and leaves) \n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]\nJoey: (To Rachel) Hey!\nRachel: Hey! Got champagne?\nJoey: Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!\nRachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone   is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove   her bra from under her clothes)...\nJoey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him) \nRachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very   sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright!   Lets do it!\nJoey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.\nRachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She   pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like   that huh?\nJoey: Oh! yeah!\nRachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively,   putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She   pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between   his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)\nJoey: uh uh!\nRachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!\nJoey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!\nRachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?\nJoey: (He just sits there, legs very close together with   a painful look on his face) Soldier down! \n[Monica and Chandlers apartment.]\nMonica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.\nChandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!\n(Phoebe and Amanda walk in)\nPhoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can   I talk to you outside for a minute?\nMonica: I have nothing to say to   you.\nAmanda: (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow,   my flat is twice this size!\nPhoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall?\n(They both walk to the door and enter the hallway.)\nAmanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look   positively ghastly.\nChandler: Well, aren't you a treat.\n[Scene: The hallway]\nMonica: I can't believe you tried to cut   me out. Why Phoebe, why?\nPhoebe: It was right after we were living together and you   were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and   shrill.\nMonica: I'm still all those things!\nPhoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!\nMonica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy.\nPhoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't   keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only   one who ever clawed her way back in.\nMonica: It's because I'm scrappy.\nPhoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your   way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.\nMonica: I won't know what I would do without   you.\n(They hug)\nMonica: Well, I guess we should go back   in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.\nPhoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right.\n(They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is \"dancing\" for   Chandler, but she's really terrible at it)\nAmanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional   dance training.\n(Monica and Phoebe look at each other and leave the apartment again) \n[Scene: A different spray-on tan center]\nGlenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the   booth, and...\nRoss: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does   it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them   all on my back.\nGlenda: (quietly) Okay...\n(Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands   with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles   at both sides of the wall)\nRoss: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one   is it?\n(He turns around frantically from side to side.)\nRoss: Which... which... which... Which one is it?\n(He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in   this face and front again.)\nRoss: OH! SON OF A BITCH!\n(He now turns to the other side, which also starts spraying his face and front.) \n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's]\nRachel: What is the matter with us?\nJoey: Well, I know what's the matter with me.\nRachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult?\nJoey: I don't know.\n(Chandler enters the apartment)\nChandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she   sure can dance... Hey!\nRachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that?\nChandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys...\nRachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...\nJoey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong?\nChandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt   like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.\n(Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get   to them)\nChandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the   good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the   joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)\nRachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.\nJoey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit.\nRachel: Right, totally.\nJoey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it.\nRachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex.\nJoey: That's a... pla-an.\n(They both stare for a while, and then look at each other)\nJoey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.\nRachel: I know.  Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what   I wanted. \nRachel: Hmmm... Me too...\n(She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.)\nRachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?\nJoey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.\n(Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder)\nRachel: Aah... I bet you're right.\n(They look at each other for a while)\nJoey: So...\nRachel: Yeah.\nJoey: I love ya.\nRachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.\nJoey: Yeah, me too.\n(Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.)\nJoey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.\n(Joey takes the ice-bucket with the champagne bottle in it and puts it on   his sore spot) \n[Scene: Ross's apartment.]\nChandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.\n(Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.)\nRoss: Go away! I don't want to see anybody.\nChandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same   thing happened to me. You have to let me in.\nRoss: Really? Did you count Mississipily?\n(Ross walks to the door and opens it.)\nRoss: Dude, you're not tanned.\nChandler: No, I just had to get a picture of this.\n(Chandler holds up a camera and takes Ross's picture.)\nChandler: I see you later!\n(Ross closes the door)\n end \n \nFRIENDS - 1004 - THE ONE WITH THE CAKE\nWritten by: Dana Klein   Produced by: Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller   Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano & Vanessa \n[Scene: Central Perk]\nMonica: (she enters) Hey guys!\nRoss, Rachel and Chandler: Hey!\nChandler: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.\nMonica: That place in Vermont? You can  take   a hint!\nRachel: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!\nRoss: Yeah!\nRachel: We're having a party.\nMonica: Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?\nRoss: No.\nRachel: No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!\nChandler: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!\nRoss: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.\nMonica: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.\nChandler: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...\nRachel: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?\nRoss: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.\nRachel: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!\nMonica: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.\nChandler: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...\nMonica: Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that! \n OPENING CREDITS \n[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment]\nRachel: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.\nPhoebe: Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!\nRoss: (he enters) Hey guys!\nRachel and Phoebe: Hi!\nRoss: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.\nRachel: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.\nPhoebe: Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!\nRoss: Yeah!\nPhoebe: Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!\nRoss: That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?\nRachel: Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.\nRoss: Ah, and where is Joey?\nRachel: I said it's still nap time.\n(Joey comes out from his room, yawning)\nRoss: (taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey!\nJoey: Hey!\nRoss: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!\nJoey: 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his \"How You Doin'\" line)  Ross: Joey, NO!\nJoey: What, what!? it's for her hot friends!\nRoss: When they see this you'll be 52!\nJoey: And starting to think about settling down!\nRachel: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?\nJoey: I'd love to! Yeah!   Joey: (To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents?\nPhoebe: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.\nJoey: Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?\nPhoebe: Joey, it's a birthday party.\nJoey: Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says \"El-moo\"! (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!\n(Monica and Chandler enter)\nMonica: Hey!\nChandler: Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?\nRachel: Oh, she's still napping\nChandler: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.\nRachel: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.\nMonica: All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!\nRachel: No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.\nMonica: Are you freaking kidding me, Green?\n(someone knocks on the door. Rachel goes to open it)\nJack and Judy: HI!\nRoss: (points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!\nMonica: So glad you came!\nJack: I can't believe Emma is already one!\nJudy: (to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!  Ross: (pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know about your dad!\nJoey: Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.\nJack: Thank you!\nJoey: Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!\nJack: Which one are you? \n(Time lapse)\nMonica: I can't believe Emma is still asleep!\nChandler: I know, what are we gonna do?\nMonica: I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!\nChandler: I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!  Phoebe: So youre gonna... hit on her?\nJoey: No, no, no! My talents as an actor!\nPhoebe: Oh!\nJoey: You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!\nPhoebe: Or you could stick a fork in an apple!\nJoey: Hey, I think Emma might like it!\nRachel: Oh! Emma might like what?\nJoey: Um, my present!\nRachel: What did you get her?\nJoey: Actually we prepared performances.\nPhoebe: Separate performances.\nJoey: But equally real!\nRachel: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?\nPhoebe: Sure, yeah!\nJoey: (unconfidently) O K.\nRachel: (to everybody) All right, lets get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.\nRoss: Oh, great!\nPhoebe: (to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?\nJoey: Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!\nRachel: So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?\nJoey: I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emmas books.\nRachel: Oh, ok, which one?\nJoey: Uh, why, its a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) Love you forever. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang Ill love you forever, Ill like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youll be. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book). And while he rocked her, he sang Ill love you forever, Ill like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youll be.\nRachel: (crying) Wow! That was amazing!\nRoss: Thank you so much for that gift!\nChandler (nearly weeping): I was not ready for this today!\nRoss: Amazing... amazing.\nRachel: Oh, Phoebe, Im sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.\nPhoebe: Thats right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For theres no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!\nRachel: Is that it?\nPhoebe: No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks up a book). Sex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.\nEverybody: No, no, no, no, no!\n[Scene: Joeys Apartment. Ross is filming his parents ]\nJudy: Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.\nJack: Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.\nJudy: Yes, youll be all grown up by then. Well be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.\nJack: Thats true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!\nJudy: After all, my parents died very young.\nJack: And my cholesterols off the charts!\nJudy: Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!\nRoss (stops recording): Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!\nRachel: Ross, um, dont forget to get a shot of Emmas cake. Its in a box in the fridge.\nRoss: Sure.\nRachel: Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corinos.\nMonica: Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.\nRachel: Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, theyll copy it in icing!\nMonica: Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?\nRachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.\nRoss: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?\nRachel: Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! They put my babys face on a penis!\nPhoebe (sees the cake): oh! Now its a party!\nRachel: Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!\nJoey (staring at the cake): Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?\nJudy:(to Jack) Jack, look at this.\nJack: I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!\nRoss: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.\nRachel (on the phone): No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughters birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!\nRoss: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babys face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!\nRachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!\nJoey: I'm so confused!\nRachel: (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!\nChandler: To be fair this one does have nuts.\n(Time lapse)\n(Ross, Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen area)\nRoss: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.\nMonica: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key! \nRoss: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!\nChandler: Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?\nMonica: We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.   You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!\nChandler: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)\nMonica: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.\nPhoebe: And you know, I have a massage client soon.\nRoss: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?\nMonica: Alright, 5 more minutes.\n(The phone rings, Ross picks up)\nRoss: (Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right there. (Puts the phone down)\nChandler: Was that Emma? Is she up? \nRoss: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.\nPhoebe: Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.\nMonica: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) We've been complaining the longest!\nRoss: No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?\nChandler: I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday! \nRoss: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)\nJoey: Got it! (Goes towards the front door   and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey!

He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)\nChandler: (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)\nJoey: Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.\nPhoebe: No, it did not.\nJoey: No.\nJudy: Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.\nJack: Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.\nJudy: Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.\nJoey: Ok! (Opens the door for them) \nJudy: Bye... Bye dear.\nJoey: Nighty-night!\nJudy: Nighty-night!\nJoey: Bye, bye.\nPhoebe: Joey? How could you just let them leave?\nJoey: Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.\nMonica: No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.\nJoey: (Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)\nChandler: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?\nJoey: Oh! I forgot you used to live here!\n(The phone rings, Joey picks up)\nJoey: Hello?\nEstelle: (on the other side of the line) Joey! It's Estelle!\nJoey: Hey! (smiles)\nEstelle: So, how did your audition go today?\nJoey: (smile fades) What audition?\nEstelle: The one I told you about last week?\nJoey: What? You never said anything about an audition!\nEstelle: (Looks confused) Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.\nJoey: A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for his \"dramatic reading\") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!\nPhoebe: Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!\nMonica: Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!\nPhoebe: Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!\nMonica: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.\nJoey: Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.\nMonica: (She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.\nJoey: Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?\nPhoebe: No, lets just draw straws.\nJoey: Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..\nChandler: I'm begging you stop.\nJoey: Right.\nMonica: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!\nPhoebe: (Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!\nChandler: (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont! \nMonica: Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)\nPhoebe: Ok! I want the dolphin!\nChandler: Thats a bear.\nPhoebe: I'm too excited!\nMonica: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!\nJoey: Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)\nChandler: Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!\n(Monica, Phoebe and Joey release their wind-up toys.)\nPhoebe: Go! Go!\nJoey: Come on robot!\n(Phoebe's bear takes the lead, followed by Joey's robot, and far behind is Chandler and Monica's dog, which walks a few paces, stops and starts barking, sits, walks again, and so on... )\nMonica: (to the dog) What are you barking at?\n(While Phoebe's bear is still in the lead, it is now closely followed by Joey's robot. Chandler and Monica's dog however, sits down, barking... and does a backflip.)\nMonica: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?\nChandler: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?\n(Meanwhile the race has been won by Phoebe's bear, followed by Joey's robot)\nJoey: Way to go robot!\nPhoebe: Good job Alan!\nJoey: Hey, good race you guys.\nPhoebe: Yeah, see you later!\n(Joey and Phoebe leave for the door)\nMonica: No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...\nChandler: They left.\n(Monica turns to see the closed door.) \n[ Scene: The freeway. Rachel is driving Monica's Porsche, while using her mobile phone. Ross is sitting next to her.]\n Rachel: (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye... \n(She hangs up, closes her phone, turns around and puts it in her bag which is in the back of the car. While doing this and not looking at the road, she turns the steering wheel by accident, which makes the car swerve.)\nRoss: RACHEL!\nRachel: OOH! God! Sorry!\nRoss: (sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.\n(Ross fastens his seat belt.)\nRachel: Emma's awake.\nRoss: Yeah?\nRachel: I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.\nRoss: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)\nRachel: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.\nRoss: Rach, she's not going to remember this.\nRachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing \"Happy Birthday\". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!\nRoss: (looks back at the cake) Hey!\nRachel: What?\nRoss: It's not bad.\nRachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?\nRoss: Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.\nRachel: Well, I'm very impressed.\nRoss: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures. \n[ Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of them.]\n Monica: Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size. \nChandler: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?\nMonica: Game?\nChandler: Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.\n(With his index finger he shows her how old she is. Emma also points her finger and babbles...)\nChandler: Ooh! That's my girl!\nMonica: That's how old you are.\nChandler: Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?\nMonica: (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...\nChandler: Me too...\n(There's a couple of seconds of silence. Then Chandler looks around...)\nChandler: There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?\nMonica: ...and head to Canada!\nChandler: I was kidding.\nMonica: I wasn't. Let's get going!\n(Phoebe enters the apartment again.)\nPhoebe: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?\nChandler: No, not yet.\nPhoebe: Oh good, I didn't miss the party.\nMonica: What about your massage client?\nPhoebe: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.\n(Joey comes running into the apartment, out of breath.)\nJoey: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!\n(Ross and Rachel enter.)\nJoey: (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!\nRoss: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.\nRachel: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!\nChandler: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.\nRachel: What?\nChandler: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)\nEmma: Wo-ish. (and holds up her finger)\n(Ross and Rachel gasp)\nRachel: Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!\nRoss: Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...\nRachel: (angrily) NO, no science camp!\nRoss: Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.\nRachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!\nMonica: Thanks!\nRoss: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.\nChandler: Let's do it, come on!\n(Rachel wipes away some tears.)\nRoss: What's wrong? Are you okay?\nRachel: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.\nPhoebe: (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.\nJoey: What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis. \nENDING CREDITS  \n[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. It's just Ross and Rachel.

You highlight the word you want to change.   Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.\nJoey: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) \"brainy, bright, clever\", I love this thing!

How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.\nRachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but   anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever   made. Honey, you deserve   true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere.

Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).\nMonica: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.\nChandler: (Still looks confused) They loved it.\nMonica: What?\nChandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter.\nMonica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?\nChandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.\n(Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller)\nAmy: Hi!\nMonica: Hey, what did you guys do today?\nAmy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.\nChandler: That sounds like fun.\nAmy: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.\n(Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma)\nRachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?\nAmy: I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?\nRachel: (sounds excited) Yeah!\n(Amy takes off Emma's hat)\nAmy: Ta-daaa!\n(Rachel looks at Emma)\nRachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?\nAmy: (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?\n(Rachel looks very shocked)\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\n Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me? \nAmy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?\nChandler: I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!\nRachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.\nAmy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?\nRachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)\n(Ross enters)\nRoss: Hey guys.   Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.\nRoss: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).\nRachel: Nah, I don't really want her to see. \nRoss: Why not?\nMonica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.\nChandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?\nRoss: Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!\n(Rachel looks worried)\nRoss: (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?\nRachel: Nothing.\nRoss: (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons. \nRachel: Oh, they're real!\nRoss: Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!\nRachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy)   You are soo irresponsible   I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!\nAmy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!\nMonica: I'm a cool, fun aunt!\nAmy: (Sarcastically) O-Okay!\nChandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!\nRachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?\nAmy: Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.\nRachel: Oh yeah? Since when?\nAmy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.\nRachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?\nRoss: That's not a thing!\nAmy: Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...\nRachel: (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.\nAmy: Enter Amy!\nRoss: (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...\nAmy: What? What are you gonna do?\nRoss: (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!\n(Amy looks at Ross, angrily.

Ella. \n[Scene: Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]\n\nPhoebe: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.\nMike: But please, let's just forget the whole thing.\nPhoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.\n(Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.)\nPhoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it?\nMike: (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?

Come on! What can't I do?\nChandler: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.\nJoey: I can do that!

Why?\nCharlie: Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.\nRoss: Your ex-boyfriend?\nCharlie: Yeah.\nRoss: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!\nCharlie: No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what?

I think that you need to fight for her!\nPhoebe: Really? You think?\nMonica: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him \"I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!\"\nPhoebe: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok!

I hate being called a liar!\nRachel: But you are a liar.\nChandler: What did I just say?\n(Joey comes out of his room)\nJoey: You still here?\nChandler: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...\nJoey: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!\nChandler: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?\nJoey: (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? (goes back into his room) \nRachel: Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)\nJoey: (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)\n(The commercial:\nJoey says \"Ichiban\". It displays a few girls dancing around and Joey fills most of the screen, he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them saying \"Lipstick For Men!\" It goes on to show him playing a guitar and putting on more blue lipstick. In the end he says seductively \"Ichiban... Lipstick For Men\" and \"Sahiko\" and it ends. Chandler and Rachel are speechless.)\n Joey: (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door). \n(Silence)\nChandler: He really is a chameleon. \n[Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters carrying the horrific 'painting' of Gladys. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]\n\nPhoebe: (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')\nMonica: (faking happiness) Oh, my! \nRachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)\n Monica: (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!\nRachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!\nPhoebe: (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.\nMonica: (offended) I like that poster!\nPhoebe: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?\nRachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!\nMonica: (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?\n[Scene: Ross' office. Ross is pacing and Benjamin enters]\n  Ross: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling) Aunt Margaret's pants size?\nBenjamin: I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process. \nRoss: (Sarcastic) No! Stop! \nBenjamin: Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant. \nRoss: (Skeptical) Really?\nBenjamin: Well... there is just one small... stipulation...\nRoss: I have to break up with Charlie?\nBenjamin: Hey, you got one right!\n(Ross shakes his head) \nRoss: You're crazy.\nBenjamin: Crazy, or... romantic?\nRoss: Crazy!\nBenjamin: Ooor...\nRoss: (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves) \n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]\n(Rachel enters, checking the mail, then looks up and sees Gladys placed on the barcalounger.)\nRachel: O-oh my God!\nJoey: (enters from his bedroom) What?\nRachel: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?\nJoey: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.\nRachel: Joey, we're not keeping this!\nJoey: But it's an original Buffay...\nRachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted. \nJoey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?\nRachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.\n(Joey's eyes are twice their size now, and looks nervously from Rachel to Gladys and back.)\nRachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.\nJoey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!\n(Joey leaves for his bedroom, and Rachel grins. She then takes Gladys and enters Monica's apartment.)\nMonica: Hey! I sold that to Joey.\nRachel: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)\nMonica: No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes the painting back to Rachel)\nRachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again)\nMonica: No you can't. She's yours!\nRachel: She's yours!\nMonica: SHE'S YOURS!\nRachel: She's yours!\n(While they are both pushing the painting towards each other, Phoebe enters)\nPhoebe: Hey! (there's a pause)\nRachel: She's mine!\nMonica: She's m-i-i-ne!\nRachel: She's mine!\nMonica: She's mine!\nPhoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.

The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!\nChandler: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.\nPhoebe: So what did you two do about it?\nChandler: It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.\nRoss: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.\nMike: I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.\nRoss: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.\nPhoebe: But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?\nMike: Are you serious?\nPhoebe: Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?\nMike: I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.

You can't have it both ways!\nJoey: Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?\nChandler: Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.\nMonica: And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.\nJoey: Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.\nChandler: (pointing at himself) Little people?\nJoey: (pointing at himself) Celebrity.\nMonica: Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?\nChandler: What...? NO!\nMonica: Chandler?\nChandler: (he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!\nMonica: Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?\nChandler: I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.\nMonica: It isn't mine!\nJoey: (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is! \n \n[Scene: The New York City Children's fund hallway.]\nCharity guy: May I help you? \nPhoebe: Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.\nCharity guy: Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.\nPhoebe: Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she gives him a check)\nCharity guy: Well, this is very generous!\nPhoebe: And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.\nMike: Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.\nPhoebe: Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.\nCharity guy: Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.\nMike: Not necessary.\nPhoebe: Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.\nMike: And \"X\" is spelled uhm... \"Mike Hannigan\".\nCharity guy: Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.\nPhoebe: Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!\nMike: It does. It feels really good!\nPhoebe: Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!

Emma will be up in a minute!\nRoss: Oh, good!\nRachel: Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.\nRoss: Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.\nRachel: Absolutely.\nRoss: There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!\nRachel: So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?\nRoss: Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!\nRachel: Oh my God, what!?\nRoss: Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!\nRachel: Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.\nRoss: Be-caaauuuse...\nRachel: (upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.\nRoss: Seriously?\nRachel: Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!\nRoss: (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!\nRachel: Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.\nRoss: Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!\nRachel: Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!\n\nRoss: Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come on, you know, when youll see the look on Emmas face, I swear you wont regret it.\nRachel: All right!\nRoss: Good, you dont want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?\nRachel: Irrational, huh? All right, well, Ill remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!\nRoss: Oh, yeah, thats the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings! \n[Scene: Monicas apartment. Somebody knocks the door]\nMonica: Oh my God, the adoption lady is early! \nChandler: Ok, ok, here we go.\nMonica: Ok.\nChandler: Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)\nPhoebe: Hello, is this the creepy residence?\nMonica: Were waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, Im glad youre here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a box on the table and opens it). I dont know if you wanna use it, but\nPhoebe: Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I wont be needing a veil, I actually wont be wearing a dress at all!\nMonica: I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding! \nPhoebe: No, no, no, were not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.\nMonica: Thats crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just cant imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!\nPhoebe: We, you know, were different! We dont care about having a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares, I dont need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.\nMonica: Thats right. Youre making a commitment and thats the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?\nPhoebe: City Hall.\nMonica: Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!\nPhoebe: Its ok, its ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)\nMonica: Yay!\nChandler: But you already gave all your money to charity!\nPhoebe: Well, Ill just ask for it back!\nChandler: I dont think you can do that!\nMonica: Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!\nChandler: Thats sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady. \n[Scene: The playground. Ross put Emma on the swing and theyre ready to play]\nRachel: Ok, careful.\nRoss: Ok.\nRachel: Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!\nRoss: Rach, shes got like three hairs!\nRachel: I know (she touches Emmas head) but theyre just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.\nRoss: I promise you shes safe! No watch how much she loves this. \nRachel: Ok.\nRoss (to Emma): Ready sweety?\nRachel: Ok.\nRoss: Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)\nRachel: Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, shes smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!\nRoss: See, I told you!\nRachel: Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, shes a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?\nRoss: Oh, absolutely!\nRachel: Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, its in the diaper bag.\nRoss: Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow! \n \n[Scene: The New York City Children's fund ]\nMike: Were seriously asking for our money back?\nPhoebe: Its for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.\nCharity guy: Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I dont think that thats ever happened before.\nPhoebe (to Mike): Gay, go.\nMike (to the charity guy): Oh my God, I love your shirt!\nPhoebe: The donation we made earlier, we k, we w, we want it back.\nCharity guy: Excuse me?\nPhoebe: Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didnt want, but it turns out we do.\nCharity guy: So youre asking us to refund your donation to the children?\nMike: Yeah! This feels really good.\nPhoebe: I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.\nCharity guy: Hey, its not my business, (he takes their check from a drawer) besides its probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing\nPhoebe: Hey, thats not fair! A persons wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didnt have a graduation party! And I didnt go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to kill me or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)\nMike: She could have been talking about either one of us.\n\n[Scene: Monicas apartment. Somebody knocks the door]\nLaura: Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.\nMonica: Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.\nLaura: Thank you!\nMonica: Would you like something to drink?\nLaura: Oh, water would be fine.\nMonica: Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. Were really excited about getting this process started.\nChandler: Oh, because we love kids. Love em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.\nLaura: Your place is just lovely.\nMonica: Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.\nLaura: You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?\nMonica: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked)\nChandler: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.\nLaura: Oh...\nChandler: What?\nLaura: I just realized why I remember this place.\nMonica: Really? What is it?\nLaura: Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.\nMonica: Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?\nLaura: Yes!\nChandler: Of course it was!\nLaura: Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.\nChandler: RAT BASTARD!\nLaura: So you're not friends with him?\nMonica and Chandler: OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!\nLaura: Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child... (someone knocks on the door)\nJoey: (form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?    (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it back in his face) OW!\nLaura: What was that?\nChandler: Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.\n\n[Scene: Ross and Rachel are at the playground with Emma. Rachel in putting her back in the stroller and Ross is tending to his wound]\nRachel: Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?\nRoss: SON OF A BITCH!

That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.\nRoss: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice. \nRachel: Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?\nRoss: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. \nRachel: (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.\nRoss: Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.\nRachel: Alright fine. I'll do it.\nRoss: Good.\nRachel: If you hold a spider. \nRoss: (He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?\nRachel: IF you hold a spider.\nRoss: I know.

Laura is standing with her back to the window, Chandler and Monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other.\nLaura: Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in.\nMonica: Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!\nLaura: Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here...\n(She starts checking her form. Chandler sees movement near the window from    the corner of his eye and when he looks he spots Joey climbing up the fire escape and onto their balcony. He warns Monica silently.)\nMonica: (Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room?\n(Joey enters through the side window and jogs towards the kitchen holding a baseball bat)\nChandler: What the hell are you doing?\nJoey: Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.\nChandler: Well, we're not.\nJoey: But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!\nChandler: We don't have a code word.\nJoey: We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.\n(Monica talks loudly in the baby's room)\nMonica: So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey behind the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler)\nMonica: (To Chandler) What room should we see next?\nChandler: Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)\nMonica: (laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom).\n(Joey gets up and look annoyed)\nJoey: (quivering with anger) I did not care for that!\nChandler: (escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.\nJoey: Ok, ok! (He leaves)\nChandler: Ok!\n(Joey leaves and closes the door behind him. Chandler walks towards the living room, but then Joey enters again.)\nChandler: What?\nJoey: I forgot my bat.\n(He picks up his bat and holds it up, but then Monica and Laura enter the living room again. When Laura sees Joey, she freezes...)\nLaura: Oh my God!\nChandler: And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)\nLaura: What are you doing here?\nJoey: (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!\nLaura: Are you friends with him?\nChandler: I can explain... Joey...\nJoey: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.\nLaura: Excuse me?\nJoey: Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.\nLaura: I gave you my number, you never called me.\nJoey: No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.\nLaura: (embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.\nJoey: Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?\nLaura: I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...\nJoey: No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the apartment, leaving her shocked)\nLaura: Joey, wait!\nJoey: (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes the door behind him)\nLaura: (laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...\nChandler: Oh, that's really ok.\nMonica: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.\nLaura: Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going to make excellent parents.\n(Chandler and Monica hug each other, and then Joey enters the apartment again.)\nJoey: LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)\n\n[Scene: The New York City Children's Fund building. Phoebe and Mike are entering.]\nPhoebe: (to the Charity guy) We're back!\nCharity guy: Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM.\nMike: No, no, we're here to give the money back.\nPhoebe: Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children. \n(the Charity guy smiles wanting to take the check, but Phoebe pulls it back again. His smile fades.) \nPhoebe: Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!\nCharity guy: If I haven't said so already sir, (sarcastically pointing to Phoebe) congratulations!\nMike: (takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should do?\nCharity guy: You know what? It's not your decision anymore.\nMike: What?\nCharity guy: On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.\nPhoebe: But... but... but we're giving you this!\nCharity guy: Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution. (gives the check to Phoebe)\nPhoebe: (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous!\nCharity guy: Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.\nMike: Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.\nCharity guy: Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.\nPhoebe: Oh, is that you?\nCharity guy: No!\n\n[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are sitting in their living room when the phone rings.]\nMonica: Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)\nChandler: Wrong number?\nMonica: It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.\nChandler: That's great!\nMonica: Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh... \n(Chandler and Monica hug and after a while the telephone rings again... Monica's eyes get bigger. Chandler answers.)\nChandler: Hello...?

Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!\nPhoebe: (sarcastic) Oh... okay. \nRachel: Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy... \nRachel: And a thousand dollars.\nRachel: ...is something I'm very interested in!

I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!\nMonica: You don't know that.\nChandler: Somebody is gonna pick us. \nMonica: Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!\nChandler: I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.

Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it. \nChandler: Tell me more.\nMonica: Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall.

There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!\nRachel: Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!\nPhoebe: Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.\nRachel: Oh, Phoebe! Come on!

Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!\nPhoebe: Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business!

I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been) I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.\nRoss: Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.\nJoey: Ohhhh! These seats are great!\nRoss: I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice (Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!\nJoey: (looks at the time) Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.\nRoss: Oh, but it's a kind game!

Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!

That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!\nPhoebe: You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!\nRoss: Yeah. What are we gonna do?\nRachel: Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.\nJoey: All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae. \nPhoebe: Alright, what are we gonna say?\nRoss: Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!\nPhoebe: Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!\nJoey: No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)\nRoss: (to Joey) HEY!\n\n[Scene: Monica's apartment.]\nMonica: Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)\nChandler: (peeping) They're out there!\nMonica: Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!\nChandler: (peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says \"Rangers\" on it. They went to the game!\nMonica: (gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!\nChandler: (looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.\nMonica: Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!\n[Cut to the hall]\n(Rachel comes out of her apartment}\nRachel: Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?\nRoss: I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.\nPhoebe: We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.\nRoss: (sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.\nRachel: You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)\nRoss: (Reading the note) We know you're out there. (Rachel gasps)\nJoey: (whispering) Who do you think its from?\n[time lapse  they are still in the hall]\nRachel: Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.\nRoss: Well, let's just go in there and face them.\nPhoebe: Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy. \nJoey: I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.\nRachel: Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).\nJoey: (smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!\nRoss: What is that? \nJoey: That's fire. Beats everything.\nPhoebe: Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his \"fire\" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out). \nJoey: Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played. \nRachel: Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.\nAll: Alright, okay. (Phoebe reaches for the door, and tries to open it but it's locked)\nPhoebe: It's locked.\nRoss: Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: \"Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy\". \nRachel: Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.\n[cut to Monica and Chandler]\nMonica: No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.\nChandler: Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?\nMonica: (Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.\nChandler: (relieved) Oh thank God!\n[cut to the hall]\nRoss: Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.\nChandler: (looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.\nRoss: (to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)\nRachel: You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)\nJoey: I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up)\n[cut to Monica and Chandler]\nMonica: That's all the turkey you're gonna get.\n[cut to the hall]\nRoss: How are we gonna decide who gets this?\nJoey: (holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)\nPhoebe: What are we gonna do? I'm starving.\nRachel: (gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.\nPhoebe: Oh yeah!\n[cut to Monica and Chandler]\nMonica: Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.\nChandler: Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)\n[cut to the hall]\n(Rachel comes out of the apartment holding a pot. Joey holds in anticipation and Rachel opens it)\nRachel: Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)\nRoss: That's worse than no food.\n[cut to Monica and Chandler]\n(Monica looks insulted)\nChandler: HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!\nMonica: Stinky?!\nChandler: Please let me stay on this side of the door.\n[cut to hall]\nRachel: Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.\nPhoebe: Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.\nRachel: You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)\nJoey: (to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.\nRoss: I don't know...\nJoey: I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.\nRoss: (Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it!\n(Rachel finally manages to open the door, but the door chain is on.)\nRachel: Oh!\n(Joey sticks his head through the gap. Monica and Chandler are now sitting at the dinner table. There is another smaller table full of food standing in front of the front door)\n(Monica and Chandler do not look amused by Joeys head in the door)\nJoey: Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...\n(Monica is now smiling)\nChandler: The cranberries...?\nMonica: Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!\nJoey: (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.\nChandler: He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)\nJoey: Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?\n(Ross head appears above Joey's, Rachel's below Joey's and Phoebe's at the bottom)\nRoss: I feel terrible.\nPhoebe and Rachel: So, so sorry.\nJoey: (smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?\nChandler: The floating heads do make a good point.\nMonica: Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.\nRachel: So bad.\nRoss : So bad.\nPhoebe: So bad.\nMonica: (Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in. \nRachel: Dessert?\nMonica: Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?\nPhoebe: Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).\n(Monica takes it and reads the label)\nMonica: Grand Supreme Little Darling?\nRachel: Congratulatioooons!\nMonica: Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.\nRoss: Really girls, not cool.\nChandler: Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.\nJoey: Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!\nRoss: It's a day to be thankful.\nJoey: (to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!\nMonica: It's too late for apologies.\nJoey: Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.\nChandler: That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.\nRachel: Ewww, is that what that is?\nJoey: Sorry!\nPhoebe: Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.\nRachel: Yeah! I'll cook!\nRoss: Yeah! Let's go out.\nRachel: Hey!\nJoey: Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.\nMonica: The three of us?\nJoey: Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!\n(Monica gasps and holds her forehead. Phoebe, Rachel and Ross pull back their heads)\nJoey: Ha!\n(When Joey tries to pull back his head, he notices he is stuck)\nJoey: Oh-oh! I'm stuck!\nMonica: Joey, that is not gonna work.\nJoey: No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.\nPhoebe: I'll pull you through.\nRoss: Okay.\nJoey: (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.\nChandler: A little late for that.\nJoey: Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.\nMonica: Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.\nChandler: Uhm, we've got turkey grease.\nMonica: Bring it.\nJoey: I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...\n(Chandler gives Monica a footlong \"eye dropper\" with the turkey grease in it)\nMonica: Here you go!\n(She squirts some of the grease along Joey's face.)\nJoey: Oh, that smells good!\n(And he starts licking the grease which trickles down his face. Monica also squirts some on the other side of his face, and his tongue follows her movements.)\nJoey: Okay.\nMonica: Okay, try it.\n(Joey tries to pull back at all his might.)\nJoey: It isn't working.\nMonica: Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.\nJoey: Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!\nChandler: Can you ever feel your ears?\nJoey: Interesting...\nMonica: Chandler, where are your tools?\nChandler: (sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!\nMonica: I do, but Rachel borrowed them.\nRachel: I lent them to Ross.\nRoss: I gave them to Joey.\nJoey: I left them at the park.\nMonica: Oh!\nRoss: (looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.\nPhoebe: I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.\nRoss: Nice!\n(The phone rings in Chandler and Monica's apartment)\nMonica: Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.\nJoey: It's really starting to hurt.\nChandler: Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!\nPhoebe: Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.\n(Rachel, Ross and Phoebe have their hands full and are stuffing all kinds of things down Joeys pants.)\nJoey: Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!\nChandler: Come on guys, PUSH!\nJoey: Yeah! Come on!\nJoey and Chandler: PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!\n(The chain breaks loose from the wall, and because Joey was pushing with all his might, he propells into the kitchen, towards the table with all the food. This table has wheels underneath it, and when Joey falls on this table, he rides into the living room, with all the food falling off, until finally Joey also falls off... Joey gets up quickly, a bit agitated, and acting as nothing happened. He is covered in food stains.)\nChandler: My cranberries!\nJoey: (looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over me.\n(He licks his fingers, liking it. He offers Chandler a taste.)\nChandler: Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!\n(Monica enters from the spare bedroom.)\nChandler: (to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!\nMonica: (very emotional) I don't care.\n(Chandler can't believe what he's hearing. He looks at Monica, then at the others, then back at Monica.)\nChandler: What's going on?\nMonica: That was the adoption agency...\nChandler: And?\nMonica: WE'RE GETTING A BABY!\nChandler: Are you serious? (they hug)\nMonica: There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!\n(They all cheer and Rachel, Ross and Phoebe join in for a group hug. Joey also joins, but he stands back a bit, because he is all sticky of the food on him)\nRachel: I'm so happy for you!\nMonica: This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!\n(They all cheer and hug again, but Joey's eating the food off his shirt)\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK", "metadata": {"chunk_type": "scene", "season": 9, "episode_number": 9, "episode_id": "S09E09", "episode_title": null, "scene_number": 15, "scene_id": "S09E09_015", "location": "Joey and Rachel's apartment.

Your adoption interview!\nMonica: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.\nJoey: I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!\nChandler: And so incorrect!\nMonica: She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.\nRoss: Come on, she's gonna love you guys!\nChandler: Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.\nMonica: And a lot could still get in our way.\nChandler: Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..\nPhoebe: What are you gonna name the baby?\nChandler: I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.\nJoey: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?\nMonica: Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!\nChandler: So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?\nMonica: You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!\nChandler: Yes, but...\nMonica: Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work!

No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!\nJoey: OW, why, why, why?\nPhoebe: Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!\nJoey: Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.\nPhoebe: Mandy.\nJoey: Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?\nPhoebe: No.\nJoey: I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks at Rachel)\nRachel: Do you think I'm someone else?\nJoey: Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?\nRachel: Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!\nJoey: (pointing at himself) Growth!\nPhoebe: Fine, I'll give you her number.\nJoey: Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy.\nPhoebe: SARAH!\nJoey: Saraaah.\nRoss: (entering) Hey!\nRachel: Hi!\nRoss: Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.\nRachel: Oh!\nRoss: (he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look?\nRachel: Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!\nRoss: C'mon! This looks good!\nRachel: Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.\nRoss: Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!\nPhoebe: Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?\nRoss: Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress. \nJoey: I can see why, nice shirt!\nRoss: You're wearing the same shirt.\nJoey: Stupid Gap on every corner! \n[Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering with a man.]\n Agency guy: Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.\nMonica: Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?\nChandler: Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: \"Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?\"\nMonica: Uh, we're gonna be great.\nChandler: You're gonna be great.\nMonica: Well... obviously!\nAgency guy: (he enters with Erica) Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.\nMonica: Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.\nErica: (whispering) Hi...\nChandler: Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.\nErica: Hi.\nAgency guy: I'll let you get acquainted.\nChandler: Ok.\nErica: So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.\nChandler: That's what our friends call us.\nErica: Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.\nMonica: I don't know about that.\nErica: You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?\nChandler: (astonished) I don't think that's exactly...\nMonica: (overlapping) Let her finish, doctor.\n\n[Scene: Central Perk]\n Phoebe: Hey! \nJoey: Hey.\nPhoebe: Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.\nJoey: Well...\nPhoebe: Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?\nJoey: Nope.\nPhoebe: What are you talking about? Sarah's great!\nJoey: Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere... \n(Sarah picks up some fries from Joeys plate and Joey looks very angry. Then were back to Central Perk and Joey does a you-see-what-I-mean look to Phoebe)\nPhoebe: Thats it? Thats why you wont go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!\nJoey: Hey, hey, look! Its not about a few fries... its about what the fries represent.\nPhoebe: What?\nJoey: ALL FOOD!\nPhoebe: Im sorry, I cant believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!\nJoey: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just dont order a Garden salad and then eat my food! Thats a good way to lose some fingers!\n(Rachel enters from the main door)\nPhoebe: (to Rachel) Oh\nRachel: Hi\nPhoebe: Thank God youre here. Listen to this!\nRachel: what?\nPhoebe: Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...\nRachel: Oh! Oh, no!\n(Joey looks satisfied)\nPhoebe: What? You know about the plate thing?\nRachel: Oh, yeah. Joey doesnt share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...\nPhoebe: (to Joey) You wouldnt let her have a grape?\nRachel: Oh no! Not me! Emma!\n(Phoebe looks horrified and she turns to watch Joey)\nJoey: (mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESNT SHARE FOOD!\nPhoebe: Well, I still think that its a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!\nJoey: (he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! Ill order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about?\n[Scene: A clothes store. Ross and Phoebe are shopping]\n Phoebe: (to Ross) This place is awesome! \nRoss: You know, we should just go, Im not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous! \n(Rachel arrives with a lot of clothes)\nRachel: Ah, this place is great!\nPhoebe: Wow!\nRoss: Rach, come on, Im not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).\nRachel: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful!\nRoss: (feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?\nRachel: Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!\nRoss: Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.\nPhoebe (walking to Ross carrying a black leather jacket): Hey, check this out! Its totally you!\nRoss: Wow!\nPhoebe: Yeah!\n(Ross wears the jackets and look at himself in the mirror)\nRoss: Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and theres a sign on the back of the jacket, boys will be boys) Boys will be boys?\nPhoebe: What? They will be!\nRoss: All right, thats it, Im getting out of here.\nRachel: No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, theres other stuff. Heres a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...\nRoss: Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.\nRachel: Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and Im... Im gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.\nRoss: Really?\nRachel: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and shes gonna go nuts for you.\nRoss: So, youre saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?\nRachel: (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?\n \n [Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are still talking with Erica.]\nChandler: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wifes a reverend, thats important to you?\nErica: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought who better then a minister to raise a child!\nMonica: Amen.\nChandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!\nMonica: Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands.\nErica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?\nMonica: It says Do it!. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.\nErica: Wow.\nChandler: Yeah, wow.\nErica: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?\nMonica: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.\nErica: (to Chandler) Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.\nChandler: No-ot for me it doesnt.\n(The agency guy enters the room)\nAgency guy: So, hows everything going in here?\nErica: Were great, I think I may have asked all my questions.\nAgency guy: Do you have any question for Erica?\nChandler: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?\nAgency guy: Yes, our system assures total anonimity. Were very proud of it.\nChandler: You should be. Youre really on top of stuff..\nAgency guy: (to Erica) Well, then if theres nothing else, then the two of us should talk.\nErica: Actually, I dont think we have to.\nMonica: We dont?\nErica: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. (to the agency guy). I've made my decision. I choose them.\nMonica: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?\nChandler: Yeah, I did.\nMonica: (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!\n [Scene: Joeys apartment. Rachel and Phoebe walk in, loaded with bags.]\n Rachel: We got some really great stuff!\nPhoebe: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.\nRachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me? \nPhoebe: Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?\nRachel: (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by  mistake, and one of mine is missing.\nPhoebe: oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.\n\n [Scene: Ross walks into Central Perk, wearing a pink and white ladies shirt. Joey is on the couch]\n\nRoss: (to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)\nJoey: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!\nRoss: (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.\nJoey: (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.\nRoss: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?\nJoey: (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!!\nRoss: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!\n \n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's hotel room. They enter.]\nChandler: We are NOT signing those papers.\nMonica: Why not?\nChandler: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.\nMonica: God works in mysterious ways.\nChandler: You have gotta stop!\nMonica: But she liked us.\nChandler: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.\nMonica: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)\nChandler: Your Veal Chop is $34,95!\nMonica: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.\nChandler: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?\nMonica: (very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.\nChandler: I know..\nMonica: I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?\nChandler: oh, honey..\nMonica: (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close.\nChandler: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.   Monica: (realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug)\nChandler: So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.\nMonica: (sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?\nChandler: You're Jewish.\nMonica: Technicality!", "metadata": {"chunk_type": "scene", "season": 9, "episode_number": 9, "episode_id": "S09E09", "episode_title": null, "scene_number": 16, "scene_id": "S09E09_016", "location": "Chandler and Monica's apartment.

Their waiter approaches with two plates.]\nWaiter: A garden salad for the lady (sets the plate down)\nJoey: Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!\nWaiter: Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!\nSarah: Mmmh, those fries look delicious.\nJoey: oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)\nSarah: (looks over at Joey's platter) Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?\nJoey: Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.\n(Sarah, is grinning and starts to reach over to Joey's plate to take a few clams)\nJoey: How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarahs fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)\nSarah: They are delicious (takes a few from the plate, puts one in her mouth and places the rest on her plate, then starts to reach over to Joey's platter again)\nJoey: (Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that?\nSarah: Oh, that is so sweet..\nJoey: Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)\n(Then she reaches over again and Joey moves his plate a little to the left, and she misses, then she reaches out again, and he moves his plate to the right , so she misses again. She tries a third time and this time, Joey pushes his plate so far to the left, it drops off the edge of the table)\nJoey: (Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!!\nSarah: What? what is the matter with you?\nJoey: I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?\nSarah: But you just said \"What's mine is yours\"?\nJoey: WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!\nSarah: Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.\nJoey: I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it). \n(Sarah looks a little disgusted)\n\n[Scene: Ross and his date walk into a lobby. They are both wearing their jackets]\n\nGirl: Wow, this place looks great.\nRoss: Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.\nGirl: Me too! (starts to take her coat off)\nRoss: Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)\n\n[Scene: Back at the restaurant with Joey and Sarah. Joey is holding Sarah's hands]\nJoey: I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.\nSarah: Sure (smiling) Just not as much as clams.\nJoey: (Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams.\n(The waiter arrives with their deserts)\nWaiter: Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.\nJoey: Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.\nWaiter: Yes, that's Raspberry coule.\nJoey: (More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to  be healthy. (pushes it aside)\nSarah: (tasting hers) Oh my God! (Looks at the waiter and then to Joey)\nJoey: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.\nWaiter: Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.\nSarah: Mmmm! Mmm!\n(Sarah's beeper starts bleeping)\nSarah: Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?\nJoey: Oh yeah, sure. No problem.\n(Joey's looking at Sarah's dessert, and takes her plate.)\nSarah: What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.\nJoey: Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule?\nSarah: (laughing) No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.\nJoey: (laughing) Really?\nSarah: Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. (puts her plate back at her side of the table)\nJoey: Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room)\n(Joey sits sideways on his chair, looking at Sarah's chocolate torte, and then looking away from it, nervously playing with his fork, drumming with it on the table every now and then.)\nJoey: (to the torte) Stop staring at me!\n(He then straightens himself, and looks at the torte)\nJoey: Why, just a tiny little...\n(He takes a little piece of Sarah's dessert. At first he doesn't think it's that special, but then...)\nJoey: Oh-oh!\nTIME LAPSE\n(Sarah enters the room again, and stops when she sees her dessert is missing. Joey has emptied her plate, and has a chocolate covered mouth, just like a kid.)\nJoey: I'm not even sorry.\n\n[Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering.]\nErica: Hi!\nAdoption Agency guy: Hey.\nChandler: Hey.\nAgency guy: So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.\nMonica: (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?\nErica: Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler)\nMonica: Look, doctor!\n(Chandler takes Monica's hand, and gets serious) Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk...(pause) We're not who you think we are.\nAgency guy: I don't understand.\nChandler: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.\nErica: What?\nAgency guy: That's impossible.\nChandler: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.\nAgency guy: I'll go check your file. Excuse me.\nErica: So who are you?\nChandler: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.\nMonica: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)\nErica: So you lied to me before?\nMonica: Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) \"bore false witness\"... See I could be a reverend.\nErica: I can't believe this. \nMonica: But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...\nErica: Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?\nMonica: Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...\nErica: I don't want to look at your file! This is over.\n(She leaves the room, but Chandler runs after her. They meet in the hallway.)\nChandler: Erica wait!\nErica: I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces)\nChandler: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.\nErica: Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?\nChandler: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.\nErica: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again)\nChandler: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?\n(They look at each other. We switch back to Monica. Chandler opens the door and she turns to look at him.)\nChandler: You still want that baby?\n(Monica plays those words back in her mind and then smiles and runs to Chandler, who is twisting with joy. They hug.)\nMonica: God bless you Chandler Bing!\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK", "metadata": {"chunk_type": "scene", "season": 9, "episode_number": 9, "episode_id": "S09E09", "episode_title": null, "scene_number": 17, "scene_id": "S09E09_017", "location": "A restaurant.

Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!\nPhoebe: Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!\nRachel: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.\nPhoebe: Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler) \nChandler: (picking up the phone) Hello.\nPhoebe: Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.\nChandler: Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.\nPhoebe: (shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either \"Liar, Liar\" or \"Betrayal\", or... \"An Affair To Remember\".\nChandler: Those are all really old!\nPhoebe: Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...\nRachel: (whispering) \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" \nPhoebe: (glancing at her) What?\nRachel: They're in a caaar...\nPhoebe: (to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later.

What do you think of the house?\nChandler: Its perfect. Its everything weve been looking for.\nMonica: Isnt it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? \nChandler: And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?\nMonica: Dont you love the huge yard?\nChandler: And the fireplace in the bedroom.\nMonica: And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!\nChandler: This is bringing out a lovely color in you!\nMonica: So? Do you think we should get it?\nChandler: I dont know. What do you think?\nMonica: I think we should.\nChandler: I do too.\nMonica: This is huge!\nChandler: I know.\nMonica: How bad you wanna smoke, right now.\nChandler: I dont know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancys car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.\nMonica: Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?\nChandler: We dont. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.\nMonica: Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.\nChandler: I know. Gooooood luck with it.\n\n[Scene: Joeys apartment. Everybody except Monica and Chandler is there.]\nRoss: I just cant see Chandler cheating!\nRachel: Im telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!\nJoey: Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just cant believe he would do this to Monica!\nRoss: I know, and with the baby coming?\nPhoebe: So, should we tell her?\nRoss: I dont know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?\nPhoebe: Why? Whod you seen him with?\nRoss: No one, Im just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)\nPhoebe: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!\nRoss: (yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mikes a great guy, it was hypothetical!\nPhoebe: All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. Youre right, he wouldnt cheat.\nRoss: Believe me, if I did see with someone, theres no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)\nPhoebe : WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?\n\n[Scene: Monicas apartment. Monica is cleaning with a vacuum and then she cleans it with a dust buster. The guys enter the room.]\nRachel: Oh, look at her, so happy!\nMonica: If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!\nJoey: Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?\nMonica: No, hes picking up dinner, why, whats up?\nPhoebe: Well, look, whatever happens, were here for you and we love you.\nMonica (puzzled): All right...\nRoss: We think Chandler might be having an affair.\nMonica: What?\nRachel: Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.\nPhoebe: They went in together. So sorry.\nMonica: Oh my God! Oh my God thats awful! What did you think of the house?\n(they all look confused and sorry for her)\nPhoebe: What?\nJoey: (walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?\nMonica: Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)\nChandler: Hey!\nJoey: (to Chandler) You son of a bitch!\nChandler: Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?\nMonica: (goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.\nRachel: Who's Nancy?\nRoss: What's going on?\nMonica: (turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.\nChandler: Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.\nJoey: I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!\nPhoebe: Why do you have a realtor?\nMonica: Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.\nJoey: (clearly shocked) What?\nRachel: Are you serious?\nMonica: When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.\nPhoebe: So you're gonna move?\nRoss: Oh my God.\nJoey: Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!\nRachel: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!\nMonica: And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...\nChandler: ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.\nRoss: (sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?\nPhoebe: Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?\nRoss: You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.\nJoey: No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)\nRoss: (to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.\n(pause before Monica and Chandler speak, they look like they are looking for the right words)\nChandler: Actually, we already found a house we love.\nRoss: What?\nMonica: And about an hour ago, we made an offer.\n(All the friends looked shocked and confused. There is a long silence.)\nChandler: Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?\nTIME LAPSE\nRoss: You put an offer on a house? \nMonica: (smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)\nPhoebe: Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?\nChandler: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.\nJoey: Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can! \nChandler: (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)\nMonica: We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?\nRachel: Yeah it is.\nJoey: What the hell are you doin'?\nRachel: Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!\nPhoebe: Yeah, but so is this.\nRoss: Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?\n\n[We fade to some flashback scenes.]\n(from 1.01 - \"The One Where Monica Gets a New Roommate - The Pilot\")\nRachel: (talking on the phone) C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. \nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\n\n(from 1.18 - \"The One With All the Poker\")\nRoss: That money is mine, Green!\nRachel: You're fly is open, Geller!\nPhoebe: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?\nChandler: Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!\n\n(from 1.07 - \"The One With The Blackout\")\nPhoebe: [looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.\n[They all look at the window, grossed out, then flinch in pain.]\nRachel: Ow, that had to hurt!\n\n(from 3.09 - \"The One With All the Football\")\nPhoebe: Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.\nThe Guys: We will. (they dont move)\nMonica: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.\nRachel: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. \n(Rachel sticks a marshmallow into Monicas nose. Monica takes it out of her nose by closing one nostril, and blowing.)\nMonica: Every year.\n\n(from 5.08 - \"The One With the Thanksgiving Flashbacks\")\nJoey: (he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!\nPhoebe: (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?\nJoey: I put it on to scare Chandler!\nPhoebe: Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!\nJoey: It smells really bad in here.\nPhoebe: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!\n(They hear Monica trying to unlock the door. So Phoebe quickly pushes his head down onto the table to make it look like the turkey is just sitting on a platter and not stuck on Joey's head.)\nMonica: Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?\nJoey: It's Joey.\n\n(from 4.12 - \"The one With the Embryos\")\nMonica: I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?\nRachel: Oooohh thats interesting.\nChandler: If you win, we give up the birds.\nJoey: (shocked) Dah!!

How many categories are there?\n(They both confer)\nJoey: Everyday use.\nChandler: Fancy.\nJoey: Guest.\nChandler: Fancy guest.\nRoss: Two seconds...\nJoey: Uhh, 11!\nRoss: 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.

His name was?\nMonica: Maurice.\nRoss: Correct, his profession was?\nRachel: Space cowboy!\nRoss: Correct! What is Chandler Bings job?\n(The girls are stumped)\nRachel: Ow...Oh Gosh!\nRoss: 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.\nMonica: Its umm, it has something to do with transponding.\nRachel: Oh-oh-oh, hes a transponcetranspondster!\nMonica: Thats not even a word!\n(Ross stops the clock, signifying the end of the lightning round.)\nMonica: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!\nTIME LAPSE\n(The door opens and Joey and Chandler ride in on the big, fake dog in triumph)\nRachel: Yknow what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!\nJoey: Hey, dont get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!\nRachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me!\nMonica: Hey, we would still be living here if hadnt gotten the question wrong!\nRachel: Well it stupid, unfair question!\nRoss: Dont blame the questions!\nChandler: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!\n\n(from 5.15 - \"The One With The Girl Who Hits Joey\")\nRoss: Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!\nChandler: (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)\nMonica: (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?\n(Ross spots Chandler and starts chasing him around the kitchen table. Chandler runs and hides behind Monica.)\nRoss: What the hell are doing?!!\nRachel: (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!\nChandler: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.\nJoey: (panicking) Dude! He's right there!\nRoss: (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!\nChandler: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.\nMonica: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.\n(There's a brief pause.)\nRoss: (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) \n\n(from 6.06 - \"The One On The Last Night\")\nMonica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. Im just gonna label it, \"What were you thinking?\"\nRachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.\nPhoebe: Ok, you guys, I dont mean to make things worse, but umm, I dont want to live with Rachel anymore.\nMonica and Rachel: What?!\nPhoebe: Youre just so mean to each other! And I dont want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!\nRachel: Well, Phoebe thats fine because Im not moving.\nMonica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Yknow, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but yknow Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, shell fold down the pages of the things she thinks that Id like.\nPhoebe: What else?\nMonica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.\nRachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.\nPhoebe: Thats nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.\nMonica: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.\nRachel: Well yknow, I dont want you to be cold.\nMonica: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)\nTIME LAPSE\n(Monica closes the door and slowly walks into Rachels old and now empty room.)\nChandler: (entering) Hey.\nMonica: She really left.\nChandler: I know. (He kisses her.)\nMonica: Thank you.\nChandler: No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)\nMonica: Can I ask you a question?\nChandler: Sure!\nMonica: What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)\n\n(from 1.09 - \"The One Where Underdog Gets Away\")\nChandler: Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\nAll: That's so sweet.\nRoss: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.\nRachel: And a crappy New Year.\nChandler: Here, here!\n\n[Scene: We're back to the present. Chandler and Monica's. They're all still at the kitchen table.]\nRachel: You can't move. You just... you just can't.\nJoey: Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong. \nPhoebe: Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.\nRoss: You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)\nRachel: Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.\n(The phone rings and Chandler goes to get it)\nChandler: Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.\nMonica: And?\n(Chandler listens to what Nancy says)\nChandler: (to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.\nMonica: We can't afford that.\nChandler: I know.\nMonica: Well, there you go.\n(Chandler and Monica hug)\nJoey: I'm really sorry you guys.\nRoss: Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.\nRachel: Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.\nPhoebe: (to Monica) You're gonna be okay?\nMonica: Yeah, we'll be okay.\nRoss: Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)\nJoey: You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.\nChandler: That's okay, we understand.\nJoey: And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?\n(Chandler gives Joey her business card, which he eagerly grabs and he leaves.)\nMonica: I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.\nChandler: Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.\nMonica: What?\nChandler: We got the house.\nMonica: Oh my God!\nChandler: I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.\nMonica: Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?\nChandler: We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.\nMonica: And a baby...\nChandler: We're growing up.\nMonica: We sure are.\nChandler: So who's gonna tell them?\nMonica: (quickly) Not it!\nChandler: Not it!

You're married to my sister. \nChandler: You're right, by saying \"nice\" I'm virtually licking her.\nRoss: Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?\nChandler: Are you asking permission to break the pact?\nRoss: Yes please.\n\n[Flashback, year 1987. Chandler enters the school's corridor. Ross is hanging some flyers on the wall. Both have a funny 80s hair and clothes.]\nRoss: Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!\nChandler: Awesome, the name really stands out.\nRoss: Thanks to a little something called \"Helvetica Bold 24 point\"!\nChandler: Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!\nMissy: Hey guys!\nChandler: Hey!\nRoss: Hey, Missy...\nChandler: You know, our band is playing on Friday.\nRoss: Yeah, yeah.

You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.\nRoss: Dude, I was gonna ask her out.\nChandler: I said it first, bro.\nRoss: Well, I thought it first, Holmes.\nChandler: (angrily) Look, if you did...\nRoss: Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.\nChandler: Totally. I had sex in High school...\nRoss: Me too. I'm good at it.\nChandler: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.\nRoss: You got it.\nChandler: All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.\nRoss: Those are the pacts!\nChandler: Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.\nRoss: Oh, oh... maybe not you!\n\n[We get back to the Class of '91 reunion, where Ross and Chandler are still looking at Missy.]\nChandler: Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.\nRoss: Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?\nChandler: Your hands are shaking.\nRoss: I know, and I can't stop sweating.

Ready, go!\nJoey: (on the screen there's the word \"Supermarket\") Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn't have said 'supermarket'. The next word appears, \"notebook\") Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...\nGene: Diary.\nJoey: Noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... Damn it!

Now for some pleasing!\n(he uses his remote to turn on the music, \"Tainted Love\" by Soft Cell, and starts dancing for Phoebe. He shakes his butt, moves his shoulders back, grabs his crotch and hops towards Phoebe. Phoebe is half horrified and half scared. He takes his hat off and throws it away, does some \"Can Can\" high kicks and swings his butt in front of Phoebe who looks at it in disgust. Then he tears open his shirt and shows her his chest and she flinches.)\nRoy: Whoa, whoa, whoa (he turn off the music). She cringed!\nPhoebe: This is how I look when I'm turned on!\nRoy: You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat?

Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)\nRoy: I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath (points at his groin)... is all man.\nPhoebe: I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?\nRoy: (making a crying face) Oh, you're mean!\nMonica: (walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...\nRoy: Damnit.

Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.\nChandler: Seriously, where did this happen?\nRoss: Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.\nChandler: Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?\nRoss: Mine.\nChandler: I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.\nRoss: No, she was definitely on my bed. \nChandler: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?\nRoss: Well, then who was on my bed?\nMonica: (screeching) OH!

A waitress brings a coffee and Phoebe wants to pay.]\n Phoebe: Oh.\nJoey: Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.\nPhoebe: (her mobile phone rings) Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! (she answers) Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me! \nMonica: (she enters with a headset on and she's speaking into the microphone) Well, it matters to me!\nPhoebe: Well, I don't care, so you pick!\nMonica: Did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.\nPhoebe: Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.\nMonica: You don't know military time?\nPhoebe: Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.\nMonica: Just subtract twelve.\nPhoebe: Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...\nMonica: (screaming) Six o'clock!\nPhoebe: Ok.\nMonica: Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?\nPhoebe: Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.\nMonica: Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.\nPhoebe: What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.\nMonica: Ooh... she backed out.\nPhoebe: She did? Why?\nMonica: I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums don't really say \"elegant wedding\". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.\nPhoebe: (looking angry) Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.\n\n[Scene: The wedding rehearsal dinner.] \nChandler: Hey!\nPhoebe: Hey!\nChandler: You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them. \nPhoebe: Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?\nChandler: No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.\nPhoebe: Rehearse it!\nRoss: Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)\nMike: Thanks for coming you guys.\nRoss: Oh, (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him) hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.\nMike: Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?\nRoss: That is why!\nMike: Yeah.\nPhoebe: So Rach.\nRachel: Yeah.\nPhoebe: Where is Emma?\nRachel: Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.\nMonica: (coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)\nJoey: Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?\nMike's mother: Yes, we are.\nJoey: Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?\nMike's father: How's that?\nJoey: You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.\nMike's father: Who in God's name are you?\nJoey: Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!\n(cut to Ross, Chandler and Rachel)\nChandler: (to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.\nRoss: Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?\nRachel: Uh... November?\nRoss: I wanna say it's not looking good.\nRachel: Hey Pheebs...\nPhoebe: What's up?\nRachel: Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.\nChandler: Heh.\nPhoebe: Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.\nRoss: What? (Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)\nRachel: Well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh, and I can leave!\nPhoebe: I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.\nRoss: Oh, man!\nChandler: This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!\nRoss: FOOTBALL!\nChandler: Thank you.\nMonica: (looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.\nPhoebe: Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!\nMonica: Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!\nPhoebe: I don't have a fax machine.\nMonica: Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!\nRoss: I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.\nChandler: I know, I hate being left out of things.\nRoss: And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...\nMike: Hey guys, how is it going?\nChandler: Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.\nMike: Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.\nChandler: What happened?\nRoss: Who cares, AND?\nMike: ...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... (Ross stands up) \nRoss: I'll do it!\nChandler: (standing up too) M-Me-me-me!\nMike: You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.\nChandler: Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.\nRoss: No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?\nMike: You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. (he leaves)\nRoss: (to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.\nChandler: Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!\nRoss: Please, you're going down!\nChandler: You are going downer!\nRoss: Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?\nChandler: (almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)\n\n[Scene: Wedding rehearsal dinner. Joey and Mike are talking.]\nJoey: So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?\nMike: Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.\nJoey: Oh, hey, my pleasure. (he suddenly becomes very serious) So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?\nMike: I intend to marry her.\nJoey: Oh, a wiseacre. (Mike looks bewildered). No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?\nMike: No more so than acting.\nJoey: Strike two!\nMike: You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?\nJoey: Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!\n(Cut to Chandler and Ross. Phoebe comes out of the ladies room and they run toward her.)\nRoss: So, what did you decide?\nPhoebe: I decided to pee.\nChandler: Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.\nPhoebe: Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!\nChandler: Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.\nPhoebe: Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking by). Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.\nRachel: (excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody, what is it!\nPhoebe: Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.\nRachel: What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.\nPhoebe: All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.\nRoss: I'll do it! (Monica approaches)\nMonica: Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)\nMike: Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?\nMonica: You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!\nMike: Is that what you say to Chandler?\nMonica: (very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)\nPhoebe: Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...\nMonica (rolling her eyes): oh God.\nPhoebe: And... moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done.\nMonica: What?\nPhoebe: YOU'RE FIRED! (mimes the CUT again) (pause and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)\n\n[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey's having breakfast; Phoebe enters the room carrying her wedding dress.]\nPhoebe: Hey!\nRachel: Happy wedding day!\nPhoebe: Oh, happy my wedding day to you!\nRachel: Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.\nJoey: Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages! \n(Monica enters the room)\nMonica: Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.\nPhoebe: Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.\nMonica: Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)\nPhoebe: Wow, this is a lot!\nMonica: Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.\nPhoebe: You won awards?\nMonica: Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.\n(Ross enters the room)\nRoss: Hey!\nMonica: Hi.\nRoss: Where's Rach?\nMonica: She's in her room, why?\nRoss: I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachel's room, knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) Oh! My God! You're breathtaking! \nRachel: What d'you want?\nRoss: You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?\nRachel: Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!\nRoss: I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!\nRachel: Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!\nRoss: Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!\nRachel: Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!\nRoss: (waving his fist in the air in triumph) YES, YES!", "metadata": {"chunk_type": "scene", "season": 9, "episode_number": 9, "episode_id": "S09E09", "episode_title": null, "scene_number": 22, "scene_id": "S09E09_022", "location": "Monica's apartment.

What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins? \nMonica: I know.\n(Mike enters the room).\nMike: Hey.\nPhoebe: Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word \"lorkins\" what flowers would that be?\nMike: (thinks a moment) Orchids?\nPhoebe: Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!\n(Joey comes out from his room)\nJoey: (to Mike) Hello Michael.\nMike: Joseph.\nJoey: May I have a word with you, please?\nMike: (looking around the room) This is... great...\nJoey: Have a seat. (Mike sits on his bed, and Joey towers over him. He starts talking in an Italian godfather-type voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) I cannot allow this. \nMike: (not amused) Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?\nJoey: More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for \"Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal.\" \nMike: Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?\nJoey: I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.\nMike: (gets up) Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her. \nJoey: (very satisfied and smiling) That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family. \nMike: That must have been one lousy movie.\nJoey: (almost crying) That was ME!\n\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is pacing and Rachel walks in.]\nRachel: Hi\nChandler: Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!\nRachel: Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.\nChandler: Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back. \nRachel: All right fine, I pick you.\nChandler: (Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make \"groom\" for Chandler.\nRachel: (not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...\n\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe is on the phone and Monica is nonchalantly \"minding her own business\".]\nPhoebe: No! We're gonna do it my way. (listens) Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. (switches calls) Hello? \n(Mike and Joey come out of Joey's room)\nJoey: I'm glad we had this little talk.\nMike: Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. (walks away) That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?\nPhoebe: Okay.\nMonica: Bye.\n(Mike opens the door and there is a gigantic ice sculpture standing in the doorway)\nMike: Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall? \nPhoebe: Oh my God, what's it doing here? \nMonica: (Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling) Uh! What a pickle.\nPhoebe: (starting to panic) Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me? \nJoey: (staring at the ice sculpture) How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (They all glare at him)\n\n[Scene: Central Perk. Ross is getting coffee at the counter. Chandler walks in.]\nChandler: How's it going? \nRoss: (smiling to himself) Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.\nChandler: (smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.\nRoss: (barely containing himself at this point) Well, you have fun tonight.\nChandler: You too. \nRoss: Oh, I will.\nChandler: Me too.\n(They walk passed each other, Ross towards the door, Chandler towards the counter, suddenly they turn around to face each other)\nRoss: Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you? \nChandler: I'm not supposed to tell you. \nRoss: I'm not supposed to tell you!\n(Cut to Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Ross storm in looking very unhappy)\nChandler: You told us both we could be in the wedding?

(he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)\nChandler: Rach, Rach, knock knock.\nRachel: Who's there?\nChandler: I'll tell you at the wedding.\nRachel: Uh.\n(Mike walks in.)\nMike: Hey, I forgot my scarf. \nRachel: You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick. \nMike: Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy. \nRoss: What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose. \n(all eyes turn to Rachel) \nRachel: (sarcastic) Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.\n(Ross and Chandler look shocked)\n(Cut to Phoebe who is in the living room, still on the phone.)\nPhoebe: Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!? \nMonica: (enjoying what she's seeing) How's it going? \nPhoebe: (to Monica) Help me.\nMonica: What? \nPhoebe: I want you to be Crazy Bitch again. \nMonica: (Sounds moved) Really? \nPhoebe: (Nearly in tears) Please? \nMonica: You really want me to come back?\nPhoebe: More than I wanna get married.\nMonica: Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.\n(Joey walks in) \nJoey: Hey, what are you guys gonna do?\nPhoebe: (sounds scared already) About what?\nJoey: The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. (Opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)\nMonica: Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!\nJoey: I don't think they are.\nRoss: (to Rachel) Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry Pheebs. \n\n[Scene: Monica's apartment. They are all sitting around.]\nMonica: (Putting down her phone) Well, the club lost it's power.\nJoey: Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.\nRachel: Since when do you watch the news? \nJoey: Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.\nRoss: (To Phoebe and Mike) I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.\nPhoebe: I know.\nRachel: Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?\nPhoebe: What? \nRachel: Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!\nPhoebe: (Turning to Mike) What do you think? \nMike: I think I wanna get married to you today. \nPhoebe: Me too!

They are a bunch of people arranging chairs, shoveling snow and making other preparations.]\nMonica: (walking around with her headset still on) OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE!

Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)\nMike's mom: Michael!\nMike: Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy!

(to his wife) Come on, sweetheart.\nMike: (to Chandler and Ross) You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.\nChandler: So technically, would this person be in the wedding?\nMike: I guess.\nChandler and Ross: I'll do it!\nRoss: No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?\nChandler: I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.\nRoss: (takes Chappy from Mike) Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!\nMonica: Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.\nMike: Oh, no! \nJoey: Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.\nMonica: Really?\nJoey: Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...\nRoss: Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.\nJoey: I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.\nMonica: Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.\nChandler: (quickly) I'll do it.\nRoss: I'll...\nChandler: (to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) Ah ah...\nMonica: Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.

A bridesmaid and a groomsman walk down the isle. Next are Rachel and Ross, who carries Chappy in his arms.)\nRachel: Geez Ross, you could have showered.\nRoss: It's the dog.\n(we cut to Monica)\nMonica: Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh, that's me.\n(She walks down the aisle with the groomsman. We cut to inside Central Perk, where Phoebe and Chandler are waiting.)\nChandler: Ready?\nPhoebe: (nervously) Okay.\nChandler: Okay.\nPhoebe: Oh wait, oh no. Wait.\n(She takes off the coat she was wearing over her wedding dress, which is violet and has a darker shade petticoat underneath which shows at one side where the dress is lifted up to about the height of her hip and connected to the petticoat.

I'll be my something blue.\nChandler: You look beautiful.\nPhoebe: Thank you.\n(They start to leave Central Perk. The band starts to play \"Here, There and Everywhere\" by the Beatles.

Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?\n(one of the groomsmen gives the rings to Joey)\nJoey: (whispering to Phoebe) Okay...\nPhoebe: When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts the ring on Mikes finger)\nMike: Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.

I should go to the hospital!\nRoss: What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...\nRachel: What?\nRoss: They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?\nRachel: Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?\nRoss: No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok?

They're staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.\nRachel: Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?\nRoss: No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.\nRachel: Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!\nRoss: Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!\nRachel: Wow. Ok.\nRoss: I'll see you in the morning (he leaves).\nRachel: Mhm-mh!\nRoss: (outside her room, talking by himself) Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!\n\n[Scene: Monica's apartment. Monica and Erica have just arrived.]\nErica: Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.\nMonica: Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.\nChandler: (enters the room wearing an \"I love New York\" t-shirt, a \"Statue of Liberty\" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!\nMonica: What is with you?\nChandler: Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.\nMonica: Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.\nErica: Thanks so much for showing me around.\nMonica: Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.\nErica: Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)\nChandler: Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father? \nErica: Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)\nChandler: That's great. \nErica: Yeah... it's almost definitely him. (Monica and Chandler look confused now)\nMonica: How's that now?\nErica: Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. \nChandler: So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too? \nErica: No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)\nMonica: Was he falsely accused of something? (They look hopeful)\nErica: No... he killed his father with a shovel. (Monica and Chandler's jaws drop) But other than that, he's a great guy. \nChandler: I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.\n(Time lapse. Chandler and Monica are in bed now)\nMonica: Are you awake? \nChandler: Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)\nMonica: Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy. \nChandler: Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.\nMonica: Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?\nChandler: I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is. \nMonica: How? \nChandler: I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?\nMonica: Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting. \nChandler: Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says \"mom\" on his shovel-wielding arm!\n\n[Scene: Joey's apartment. He is sitting on the barcalounger holding a French study book and listening to a French learning tape.]\nTape: We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.\nJoey: Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!\nTape: Good job.\nJoey: Thank you. \n(Phoebe enters)\nPhoebe: Hey Joey.\nJoey: Hey!\nPhoebe: Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.\nJoey: Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!\nPhoebe: Really, can I hear some of it. \nJoey: Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) \"Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu\" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though) See?\nPhoebe: Well, you're not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH! \nJoey: (offended) Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.\nPhoebe: How could you possibly think that? \nJoey: For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!\n\n[Scene: The hospital. Rachel is pouring her self a cup of coffee. Ross approaches from behind.]\nRoss: Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee? \nRachel: (She turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)\nRoss: You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay? \nRachel: Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)\nRoss: You sure you're alright?\nRachel: (coldly) Yep.\nRoss: (knowing she's not alright) O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)\nRachel: FYI..\nRoss: (knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)\nRachel: In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)\nRoss: (half amused) Wait, wait, (looks around a little) You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.\nRachel: (sarcastically) Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!\nRoss: (acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...\nRachel: Oh stop that! \nRoss: I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding. \nRachel: (sarcastic) Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)\nRoss: Hey, I was looking out for you.\nRachel: Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.\nRoss: I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.\nRachel: Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)\nRoss: Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.\nRachel: What?\nRoss: That's right, sex is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green, are you feeling better?

Ooh, I like it.\nJoey: (enters) Hey guys.\nChandler: Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?\nJoey: No, thank you.\nMonica: All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.\nChandler: Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.\nJoey: But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.\nMonica: Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.\nJoey: You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!\nChandler: Damn it.\nMonica: See you guys later.\nPhoebe: Okay!\nMonica: (to Joey) I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.\nPhoebe: Good for you. That was really mature.\nJoey: What? No, the only reason  I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.\nMike: You're a strange kind of grown-up.\nPhoebe: Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just... \nMike: Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?\nPhoebe: All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.\nJoey: Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that \"thing\". What is it?\n(Phoebe whispers something in Joey's ear, but after hearing it he jumps up, shocked)\nJoey: I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! (he leaves)\n\n[Scene: A restaurant. Rachel enters.]\nRachel: (to maitre d') Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.\nMaitre d': Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.\n(They walk to the table, but Rachel suddenly gasps. Sitting there is mr Zellner, her boss from her current job at Ralph Lauren.) \nRachel: Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.\nMaitre d': I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.\nRachel: But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.\nMaitre d': I know. With Gukki \nRachel: Sssshhhh!\nMr Zellner: Rachel?\nRachel: Hi... I'm on a date...\nMr Zellner: (confused) That's great!\nRachel: Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.\nMr Zellner: Well, you got uhm... good energy.\nRachel: Oh.\nMr Campbell: Rachel?\nRachel: Yes, hi!\nMr Campbell: James Campbell...\nRachel: Hi! (to mr Zellner) Excuse us.\nMr Campbell: Please... (shows her to sit)\nRachel: Okay. Oh, yeah... (whispering to mr Zellner) Oh he's cute!\nMr Campbell: So... your resum is quite impressive. (Mr Zellner who sits behind Rachel shrugs) \nRachel: Wha... My resum? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resum.\nMr Campbell: Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resum.\nRachel: (starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened to just singing for  no reason? Huh?\nMr Campbell: Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?\nRachel: What? I-I don't.\nMr Campbell: You don't?\nRachel: No, I-I-I love it there. \nMr Campbell: Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?\n(Rachel mimes and mouths to mr Campbell \"That is my boss\", pointing to mr Zellner)\nMr Campbell: What?\n(Rachel now silently whispers \"That's my boss\".)\nMr Campbell: That's Hugo Boss?\n(Rachel holds her hand in order to support her head. Mr Zellner obviously overheard the conversation.)\n\n[Scene: A  counter at a government building. Phoebe's waiting in line.]\nPhoebe: (to the woman behind her) This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. (she turns around and the clerk behind the counter heard her.) But you obviously haven't.\nClerk: How can I help you? \nPhoebe: I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. (the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever) You're fun.\nClerk: You need to fill out this form. (motions for the next person in line) \nPhoebe: Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?\nClerk: It can be anything you want.\nPhoebe: Well, not anything, I mean...\nClerk: Yeah... anything.\nPhoebe: Oh, this could take a while.\nClerk: Get out of my line.\nPhoebe: Okay.\n\n[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Monica are there when Phoebe enters.]\nPhoebe: Hey!\nMonica: Hey Pheebs.\nPhoebe: Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.\nMonica: Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.\nPhoebe: Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.\nChandler: That's what we were gonna name the baby.\nMonica: Phoebe!\nPhoebe: Uh! Princess Consuela.\nMonica: You seriously changed your name to that?\nPhoebe: Uh-huh! \nMonica: Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?\nPhoebe: Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.\n(Rachel enters, looking depressed)\nChandler: Hey, how'd the interview go?\nRachel: Oh! It's not good.\nChandler: You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.\nRachel: Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.\nChandler: That is a bad interview.\nPhoebe: What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?\nRachel: Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said \"Wait a minute! Yes I am.\" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true. \nMonica: Oh God. I'm so sorry.\n(Ross enters with a bottle in his hand)\nRoss: Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? (showing the bottle) Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?\nPhoebe: Ross...\nRoss: I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!\nAll (except Rachel): Congratulations! (Rachel looks devastated)\nRoss: This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!\nGunther: Six? You want me to join you?\nRoss: Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. (Gunther leaves, hurt) Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow. \nChandler: Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!\nRoss: I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?\nRachel: Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.\nRoss: Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.\nPhoebe: Can you?\nRachel: Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!\nRoss: And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.\nPhoebe: And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. (Rachel mouths \"aah\")\nRoss: But also knowing it means a lot.\nMonica: But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.\nRoss: ...that center around work.\nChandler: To Ross!\nAll (except Rachel): Ross!\n(they all drink from the champagne, but clearly dislike the taste of it)\nRoss: You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.\nPhoebe: Oh God!\nRoss: No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. (Rachel starts crying) Oh, look at you. Look  how happy you are for me.\nRachel: (crying) No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.\nRoss: Rach, I'm so sorry.\nRachel: Oh!\nRoss: Great. I feel like an idiot.\nRachel: No, it's okay, you didn't know.\nRoss: Oh... (to the others) Little heads-up would have been nice.\n\n[Scene: Chandler and Monica's future house. They enter the living room with the realtor and Joey.]\nMonica: Thank you for letting us see the house again.\nChandler: And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.\nRealtor: Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through. (she leaves the room) \nMonica: Ah, so glad you decided to come.\nJoey: Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.\nChandler: What?\nJoey: Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.\nMonica: No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.\nJoey: Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.\nMonica: Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.\nJoey: Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs out and hits him) \nMonica: No it's not!\nJoey: (squinting his eyes) Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!\nChandler: When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?\nJoey: (glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.\nMonica: Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here. \nJoey: FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. (He turns his back to them and starts humming) Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... \nMonica: Joey, we know that's you.\nJoey: no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm\n\n[Scene: Phoebe is at Central Perk. Mike enters.]\nMike: Hey (He kisses Phoebe)\nPhoebe: Welcome back!\nMike: Ah! I missed you\nPhoebe: Oh, me too!\nMike: So, what's new?\nPhoebe: Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.\nMike: That's great! You changed you name?\nPhoebe: Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock! (She smiles from ear to ear)\nMike: (afraid) You're kidding right?\nPhoebe: Nope.\nMike: You really did that? \nPhoebe: Yep.\nMike: Yeah, but you can't do that.\nPhoebe: Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.\nMike: (looks at her astonished) Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.\nPhoebe: Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?\nMike: Crap Bag.\nPhoebe:(not amused) Mike Crap Bag?\nMike: No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.\nPhoebe: You're not serious, right?\nMike: Yeah, I'm serious. (sarcastic) It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!\nPhoebe: Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it. \nMike: I do love it, and I love your name.

She really needs this job.\nRoss: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?\nMonica: How is that gonna happen?\nChandler: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?\nRoss: I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party.

Chandler and Monica walk in.]\nMonica: Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.\nChandler: We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.\nMonica: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?\nChandler: What do you think Pheebs?\nPhoebe: Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?\nChandler: Yeah.\nPhoebe: She died.\nChandler: You're kidding!\nMonica: That's terrible!\nPhoebe: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.

He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.\nMonica: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?\nPhoebe: Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.\nMonica: What if he reads it in the paper?\nChandler: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay. \n[Scene: Ralph Lauren.

I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.\nMr Zelner: Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?\nRoss: Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.\nMr Zelner: Wow, that is tempting. \nRoss: Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?\nMr Zelner: She is good!\nRoss: (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.\nMr Zelner: But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.\nRoss: I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one up.) Is this your son? \nMr Zelner: Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What?\nRoss: Oh, nothing, its just, its close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance? \nMr Zelner: Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?\nRoss: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and thats not good. Let me start again. Im a paleontologist, youll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones fossils!\nMr Zelner: You can really arrange that?\nRoss: You let Rachel come back, and its done. \nMr Zelner: Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing in the world.\nRoss: Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.\nMr Zelner: Thats great. I worry about little Ross.

Maybe the other couple will.\nChandler: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.\nMonica: (Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands) All right.

(pause) What is all this stuff?\nMonica: Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.\nJoey: (entering the room) Hey.\nChandler: Hey.\nRoss: Hey, where's Rach?\nJoey: Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.\nRoss: Great.\nJoey: Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?\nMonica: Yeah.\n(Rachel enters the room)\nEverybody: Hey Rach, hey you.\nRoss: Here she is!\nRachel (crying): Hi you guys!\nJoey: What did I just say?\nRachel: No, no, no.

Rachel and Phoebe are sitting on the bed.]\nRachel: Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.\nPhoebe: Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  (she takes something out from her pocket) but I do have something for you.\nRachel: Oh, oh. (she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?\nPhoebe: It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!\nRachel: I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture! \n\n[Scene: Monica's apartment.

These aren't mine.\nChandler: Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!\nMonica: That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.\nChandler: Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?\nMonica: Rachel used to live in that room.\nChandler: Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)\nMonica: Joey's bare ass!\nChandler: (he doesn't look excited anymore).

Oh my God...\nPhoebe: Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.\nRoss: Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.\n\n[Scene: The guest bedroom. Rachel and Monica are talking to each other.]\nRachel: Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...\nMonica: I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too. \nRachel: (starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she's saying) I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you... \nMonica: (having the same problem) You're the best friend I ever had.\nRachel: (says something that cannot be understood)\nMonica: What? \nRachel: I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)\nMonica: That is so sweet. (they hug)\n\n[Scene: Back to the living room. Monica and Rachel enter and hug each other. The guys see this.]\nRoss: (to Joey) Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.\nChandler: Uh, Rach?\nRoss: Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her. \nJoey: I really made you think about that thing uh?\nChandler: (to Rachel) Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)\nRachel: (laughs) Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.\nChandler: No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.\nRachel: Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...\nChandler: Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?\nRachel: Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.\nChandler: Pheebs!\nPhoebe: (from the other side of the room) Yeah!\nChandler: I think these are yours.\nPhoebe: These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.\nRachel: (to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?\nChandler: Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?\nPhoebe: Where do you think Mike really is? (she giggles, Chandler looks aghast) \n\n[Scene: The guest bedroom. Chandler and Rachel.]\nRachel: Oh honey... \nChandler: Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.\nRachel: (all mushy) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug) \nChandler: Ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.\nRachel: Okay. Oh...\n(Chandler blows raspberry again)\nRachel: Oh!\nChandler: I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't. \n\n[Scene: Monica's living room. We look outside to the balcony where Rachel is saying goodbye to Joey.]\nMonica: (to Ross) So, I guess you're next. You're ready?\nRoss: I don't think so. \nChandler: Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.\nMonica: You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.\nChandler: That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. \nRoss: God! I can't believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) Why are they taking so long? \nPhoebe: I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.\n(Rachel and Joey hug, and Rachel turns to enter the apartment through the side window again. At that moment Joey tries to climb over the edge of the balcony.)\nAll: No, no, no, no!\n(Rachel rushes back and pulls Joey back onto the balcony, and takes him inside.)  \nRoss: Okay, here we go...\nRachel: Oh... (holding Ross's shoulder) Well...\nRoss: Yeah...\nRachel: I think I'm gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back, but he looks very surprised) \nRoss: Huh?\nRachel: Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.\n(She leaves the apartment and they all stare at Ross)\nRoss: What?

I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad? \nRoss: No, I don't think so.\nPhoebe: You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk.

Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.\nChandler: Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.\nMonica: You did?

I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... (she looks likes she is in pain, holding her belly) Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.\nMonica: Erica, are you okay?\nErica: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.\nMonica: Oh my God!\nChandler: Relax! We just get her some antacids.\nMonica: She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.\nChandler: Oh my God!\nPhoebe: Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.\nMonica: All right, Chandler get the coats.

Rachel bursts in.]\nRachel: You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?\nRoss: That's what it seemed like.\nRachel: I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.\nRoss: Fine, then why didn't you say something?\nRachel: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!\nRoss: Rach!\nRachel: What?\nRoss: You keep, you keep... You can't...\nRachel: WHAT?\n(Ross walks over to her and starts to kiss her passionately.

So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?\nErica: What?\nChandler: Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.\n(Erica just looks at him like he's crazy.)\nChandler: One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows?

Did something happen with you two?\nRoss: Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!\nJoey: Oh my God. You and Rachel?\nRoss: I know, it's pretty great.\nJoey: So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?\nRoss: Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.\nPhoebe: But do you wanna get back together?\nRoss: I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right.

We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited.

It's a \"welcome home\" sign for the baby.\n(He holds up a white poster with huge red letters. It reads, \"Welcome   Home Baby.\" There is also a huge red stain on the left of the poster.)\nPhoebe: How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?\n(She points at the stain.)\nJoey: No, I sat in the paint.\n(Ross enters with a gift for the baby.)\nRoss: Hey.\nPhoebe: Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?\nRoss: No, and I'm not going to.\nPhoebe: What?\nJoey: Why not?\nRoss: Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.\nPhoebe: How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.\nRoss: Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.\nJoey: Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...\n(He sits down in the wet paint again.)\nPhoebe: Uh, Joe?\nJoey: Damn it!\nRoss: Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.\nPhoebe: No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!\n(Mike enters with a roll of paper in his hand.)\nMike: Hey!\nPhoebe: Hey! What do you have there?\nMike: Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..\n(He shows them a beautiful banner he has made. It reads, \"Welcome to the World, Baby Bing.\")\nRoss: Oh my God! You did that yourself?\nPhoebe: Honey, that's gorgeous!\nJoey: You know, the baby can't read, Mike!\n(Rachel enters.)\nRachel: Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe   they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the   baby!\nJoey: Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here   any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.\nPhoebe: Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's   baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.\n(Monica enters carrying her son.)\nRachel: Oh my God!\nRoss: Oh my God!\n(They all walk over to see the baby.)\nRachel: Hi! Oh my gosh!\n(Chandler enters carrying his daughter.)\nChandler: Hey.\n(Everybody turns around.)\nPhoebe, Ross, Rachel: Hey.\n(They turn back around to see the baby Monica's carrying, but then they realise what the surprise is.

He gasps.)\nRoss: Oh my God!\nRachel: What... What...\nRoss: Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?\nMonica: Yes, it's twins!\nRoss: Oh my God.\nJoey: Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?\nMonica: (points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at the baby Chandler is holding) and that's a girl.\nChandler: Her name is Erica.\nRachel: Aw..\nJoey: Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.\nChandler: Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time   together.\nMonica: Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.\nRoss: Aw, he's gonna be so happy.\nPhoebe: Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s   newspaper guy, you know? \"Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow   this story wide open!\"\n(Chandler and Monica carry Erica and Jack over to the crib and put   them down carefully.)\nRachel: Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.\nMike: (To Phoebe) I want one.\nPhoebe: Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my   coat.\nMike: Seriously. Wanna make one of those?\nPhoebe: One? How about a whole bunch?\nMike: Really?\nPhoebe: Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the   Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis.

Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.\n(She leaves.)\nPhoebe: So, you just let her go?\nRoss: Yeah.\nJoey: Hey, maybe that's for the best.\nRoss: Yeah?\nJoey: Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?\nPhoebe: But now she'll never know how he feels!\nJoey: Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so   long, maybe now that you're on different continents..

What do you, what do you think she's going to   say?\nRoss: I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least   I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.   Where - where is my coat?!\nPhoebe: You didn't bring one!

Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?\nRachel: Yeah.\nPhoebe: (To Ross) For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.\nRoss: Yay.\nPhoebe: Uh, Rach, hang on.\n(Phoebe tries to give her phone to Ross, but he won't take it. He mouths \"no.\")\nRachel: Phoebe? Is everything okay?\nPhoebe: Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.\nRachel: What? Why?\nPhoebe: I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.\nRachel: Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.\n(The passenger in the seat next to Rachel looks at her and seems a little nervous.)\nRachel: Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.\n(Rachel hangs up.)\nPassenger #1: Uhm, what was that?\nRachel: Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.\nPassenger #1: Okay, that doesn't sound good.\nRachel: I wouldn't worry about it.

I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.\nRoss: Oh my God!\nRachel: (on the answering machine) Excuse me?\nAir stewardess: (on the answering machine) Miss? Please, sit down!\nRachel: (on the answering machine) I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.\nAir stewardess: (on the answering machine) Miss, I can't let you off the plane.\nRoss: Let her off the plane!\nAir stewardess: (on the answering machine) I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.\nRachel: (on the answering machine) Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!\nRoss: Try to understand!\nRachel: (on the answering machine) Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...\n(The message is finished. Ross jumps over to the answering machine.)\nRoss: No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?\nRachel: I got off the plane.\nRoss: You got off the plane.\n(He walks over and kisses her.)\nRachel: I do love you.\nRoss: I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.\nRachel: Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.\nRoss: Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.\nRachel: Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.\nRoss: This is it. Unless we're on a break.\n(Rachel gives him a look.)\nRoss: Don't make jokes now.\n(They kiss again.)", "metadata": {"chunk_type": "scene", "season": 9, "episode_number": 9, "episode_id": "S09E09", "episode_title": null, "scene_number": 45, "scene_id": "S09E09_045", "location": "Monica and Chandler's apartment.

Joey and Phoebe are sitting by the window, while Ross and Rachel are standing together. The apartment is completely empty. Two men are carrying a large dresser.]\nMonica: Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.\n(Two other men are rolling the big white dog out of the apartment.)\nMonica: If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.\n(She slips them some money.)\nRoss: Wow.\nRachel: I know. It seems smaller somehow.\nJoey: Has it always been purple?\nChandler: (to his children) Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!\n(Monica and Chandler put Jack and Erica in their stroller.)\nPhoebe: Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?\nMonica: Oh, yeah, that's true.\nRoss: Uh, I haven't.\nMonica: Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?\nRoss: Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?\nMonica: Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.\nChandler: Oh, okay.\n(Chandler and Monica walk over to the kitchen-counter and leave their keys. Then the other four pick out their keys and leave them as well.)\nPhoebe: So, I guess this is it.\nJoey: Yeah. I guess so.\nMonica: (crying) This is harder than I thought it would be.\nChandler: Oh, it's gonna be okay.\n(Chandler hugs her. Monica hugs Ross and Rachel as Chandler gets the stroller with the twins.)\nRachel: (crying) Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?\nMonica: We got some time.\nRachel: Okay, should we get some coffee?\nChandler: Sure. Where?\n(They all leave the apartment. Joey helps Chandler with the stroller in the hallway, while Monica and Rachel have their arms around each other. Everybody walks downstairs to Central Perk. The camera goes inside the apartment again, and it pans around. We see the keys on the counter, and the final shot is of the frame around the peephole. The screen fades to black.)\nTHE END", "metadata": {"chunk_type": "scene", "season": 9, "episode_number": 9, "episode_id": "S09E09", "episode_title": null, "scene_number": 46, "scene_id": "S09E09_046", "location": "Monica and Chandler's apartment.
