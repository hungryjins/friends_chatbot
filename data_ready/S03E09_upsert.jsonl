Monica and Phoebe then both grab her legs in order to stop Joey, who still manages to fight through the tackle and score the touchdown.]\n[Sequence 3: Chandler is running with the ball, Phoebe flashes him again, but Chandler covers his eyes, and keeps running. He then runs into a tree at the end of the field.]\n[cut to the girls huddle]\nMonica: All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and were down by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.\nRachel: No! Come on! Dont make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.\nMonica: Honey, theres a reason.\nRachel: God, Im not lame, okay. I can do something.

Three-Mississippi!\n(They all rush toward Rachel, who panics and runs away. She runs out of the park and up along the fence, she then comes back into the park and runs past Monica, as she gets to Monica, she throws the ball at Monica, and it hits her in the eye.)\nRachel: Im so sorry! Are you okay?\nMonica: No! Im not okay!\nRachel: Im sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didnt know what to do.\nJoey: (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!\nChandler: Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!\nMonica: Come on! Come on! Hurry! Were running out of time! Huddle up!\nPhoebe: Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.\nMonica: All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.\nRachel: (on the verge of tears) Okay.\nMonica: Break!\n(In slow motion, Phoebe snaps the ball, Rachel goes long. Joey and Chandler and all over Phoebe, leaving Rachel wide open. Ross starts to rush Monica, who sees Phoebe is double covered, in desperation she throws to Rachel. We see flying through the air, and then Rachel running underneath it, then the ball, then Rachel again, then the ball, then Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey staring at it in shock. Then with the grace of Jerry Rice (no offense to Jerry Rice), Rachel catches the ball, and she stops and spikes the ball. Both Phoebe and Monica erupt in celebration.)\nRachel: (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!\nChandler: Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so youre five feet short, so we win!\nPhoebe: Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isnt the play still going.\n(they all start to dive for the ball and Monica and Ross grab it at the same time.)\nRoss: Let go! Let go!\nMonica: Let go! Im a tiny little woman!!\nChandler: Guys! Guys! Come on! Its Thanksgiving, its not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me!
