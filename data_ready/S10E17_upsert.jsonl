I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.\nMonica: Oh my God!\nChandler: Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.\nMonica: She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!\nChandler: Oh my God!\n\n[Cut to Ross's apartment. Ross and Rachel are there. It's another scene from 1016 TOW Rachel's Going Away Party.]\nRachel: So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.\nRoss: Rach!\nRachel: What?!\n(He walks over and kisses her. They pull back, Rachel looks at him,  and they kiss again.)\n\n[Scene: Ross's bedroom. Rachel is putting on her shoes as Ross shows up from underneath the covers.]\nRoss: Hey.\nRachel: Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.\nRoss: Oh. This was amazing.\nRachel: It really was.

Good.\nChandler: Next time, can I say breathe?\nMonica: No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?\nErica: No, I'm okay.\nMonica: Alright, I'll be right back.\nChandler: Where are you going?\nMonica: To use the bathroom.\nChandler: You can't leave me alone with her.\nMonica: What?\nChandler: This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!\nMonica: What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?\nChandler: It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.\nMonica: You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.\nChandler: Okay.\n(Monica leaves, and Chandler closes the door. Erica just looks at him.)\nChandler: So, ah... Any plans for the summer?\nErica: I don't know. Maybe church-camp?\nChandler: Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?\nErica: What?\nChandler: Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.\n(Erica just looks at him like he's crazy.)\nChandler: One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things?  Like this.\n\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Joey is there as Phoebe enters. Joey is holding a baby duck.]\nPhoebe: Morning.\nJoey: Hey!\nPhoebe: What's that?\nJoey: It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.\nPhoebe: It's a baby chick and duck!\nJoey: Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.\nPhoebe: I did not see that coming.\nJoey: Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.\nPhoebe: Yes.\nJoey: Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.\nPhoebe: That is the rule, though.\n(Ross enters.)\nPhoebe: Guess what? You're almost an uncle!\nRoss: What?\nJoey: Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!\nRoss: Oh my God!\nPhoebe: Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.\nRoss: Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.\nPhoebe: Have you seen him throw a ball?\nRoss: Is Rachel here?\nJoey: Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.\nRoss: Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.\nPhoebe: What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?\nRoss: Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!\nJoey: Oh my God. You and Rachel?\nRoss: I know, it's pretty great.\nJoey: So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?\nRoss: Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.\nPhoebe: But do you wanna get back together?\nRoss: I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.\nPhoebe: (screaming) YAY!\nRoss: Shhh!\nPhoebe: (quietly) Yay!\nJoey: So, so is she still going to Paris?\nRoss: Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.\nPhoebe: Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! (Singing) \"Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes...\"\n(Rachel enters from her room.)\nRachel: Morning!\nPhoebe: Guess we'll never know how it ends.\nJoey: Okay.\nRoss: Hey.\nRachel: Hey.\nRoss: Hey. How did you sleep?\nRachel: Good. You?\nRoss: Good.\nJoey: I bet you did!\nRoss: Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?\nJoey: Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?\nRachel: Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...\nPhoebe: (interrupting) Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.\n(Joey and Phoebe leave.)\nRoss: So...\n(He kisses her.)\nRoss: Morning.\nRachel: You too. Last night was just wonderful.\nRoss: It really was.\nRachel: I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.\nRoss: I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.\nRachel: Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.

I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!\n(Monica gives Chandler a look.)\nDoctor: The baby's head is crowning.\n(Monica walks down to Erica's legs to watch the birth.)\nMonica: Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!\n(Chandler is standing by Erica's head.)\nChandler: I'm okay.\nMonica: Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!\nChandler: Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.\nDoctor: Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...\n(The baby starts crying, and the doctor holds it up.)\nMonica: It's a... It's a boy!\nChandler: Wow!\nErica: Is he okay?\nDoctor: He's just fine.\nMonica: Oh, you did it!\nChandler: (emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some   other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.\nDoctor: Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?\n(A nurse gives Monica a pair of scissors. Monica gives it to Chandler, and they cut it together.)\nChandler: Well, that's spongy.\nMonica: (to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much   that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on   the verge of tears) Oh, we are so lucky!\nChandler: I know. He has your eyes.\n(Monica looks at him.)\nChandler: I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.\nNurse: We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.\n(The doctor hands the boy to the nurse, and she walks over to another part of the room with him.)\nChandler: Okay.\nMonica: (To Erica) Oh my God, he's beautiful.

The other one will be along in a minute.\n(Chandler stares at the doctor, completely shocked. Monica just freezes and turns around slowly.)\nMonica: I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?\nDoctor: The next baby should be along in a minute.\nMonica: We only ordered one!\nDoctor: You know it's twins, right?\nChandler: Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\n[Scene: The hospital. Continued from earlier.]\nDoctor: I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.\nChandler: Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.\nMonica: (to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?\nDoctor: Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.\nMonica: (to Erica) Anybody tell you?\nErica: I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.\nMonica: This is unbelievable.\nErica: Twins actually run in my family.\nChandler: Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?\n(They walk over to the door.)\nChandler: What do we do?\nMonica: What do you mean \"what do we do\"?\nChandler: (panicking) Twins! Twins!!\nMonica: Chandler, you're panicking!\nChandler: Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep   one, and then just like have an option on the other one?\nMonica: We can't split them up!\nChandler: Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.\nMonica: Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?\nChandler: What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?\nMonica: Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.\nChandler: Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!\nMonica: That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of \"Eight is Enough\" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!\nChandler: (smiles) Okay. Shhh...\n(He hugs her.)\nChandler: Okay.\nMonica: Okay!\nChandler: Okay!\nDoctor: It looks like we're about ready over here.\n(Monica and Chandler run back to Erica's bed.)\nDoctor: Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.\nErica: Ow!\n(Erica screams.)\nDoctor: Here she comes!\nChandler: (shocked) She? It's a girl?\nDoctor: Yeah.\nChandler: (To Monica) Well, now we have one of each!

So, did you talk to Rachel?\nRoss: No, and I'm not going to.\nPhoebe: What?\nJoey: Why not?\nRoss: Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.\nPhoebe: How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way.

Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?\nPhoebe: But now she'll never know how he feels!\nJoey: Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way?
