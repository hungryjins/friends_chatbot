Let me see that! (Grabs the book from him.)\nJoey: (laughing) You fall for it every time!\nPhoebe: (entering) Hey!\nRachel: Hi!\nPhoebe: I brought you my old maternity clothes!

(Theres a stretchy part in front.) And then after the babys born, theyre great for shoplifting melons.\nMonica: (entering) Oh good youre all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four oclock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?\nRachel: No.\nMonica: He was in Rosss classmarching bandkinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.\nRachel: Wow! I dont remember him. Honey, are you sure youre not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.\nMonica: No that was Jarred! Wow! I havent thought about him in a long time (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm Wills, Wills here on business and he didnt have a place to go so I invited him here.\nRachel: Oh thats nice.\nMonica: Oh, and by the way, hes lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.)

Theyre ugly and stupid and delicious!\nMonica: All right! Okay, its just Phoebe. Wills still on a diet, Chandler doesnt eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachels having her aversion to poultry.\nJoey: She is?\nRachel: Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?\nJoey: Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.\nMonica: Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.\nJoey: But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!\nMonica: All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.\nJoey: No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!\nMonica: All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?\nJoey: Thats right! Cause Im a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit!

J }\n(Phoebe joins Chandler on the couch as there is a knock on the door which Monica answers.)\nMonica: Hey!\nWill: Hey!\n(Oh, I should point out that the live studio audience at this point goes absolutely wild. And I had absolutely no idea that this Will character was that popular! Maybe they should make him the seventh friend. Which would work out just fine since hes already married to one of them. Will is played by some guy named Brad Pitt, I guess hes some sort of actor.)\nWill: Happy Thanksgiving!\nMonica: Aww thanks! God Will Im so glad that you came! You look great! You mustve lost like\nWill: 150 pounds. Yeah, Im gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.\nMonica: A pie! (Will brought a pie.)\nWill: Oh right.

She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, Im in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? (Starts looking.) No Will no!\nChandler: (To Phoebe) Yknow, its been a while since weve screamed something. Maybe we should.\nPhoebe: Oh okay.\nChandler: Oh come on!\nPhoebe: Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!\n(Joey enters eating potato chips.)\nMonica: Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, youve got almost an entire turkey to eat.\nJoey: Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin chips is like stretching.\nMonica: All right.\nJoey: Dont worry, Tribbianis never get full.\nWill: I actually know what youre talking about.

(Next to Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)\n(Monica sets something on the table and removes the cover. It kinda looks like turkey.)\nJoey: Thats it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!\nMonica: (laughs) This is Chandlers chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down a huge turkey.)\nJoey: (quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?\nMonica: About nineteen pounds.\nJoey: (To Rachel) Its like me when I was born.\nRachel: All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?\nWill: Oh, youd like that wouldnt ya?\nRachel: What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh yknow what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!\nWill: (sneeze talks) Typical.\nRachel: Im sorry.

You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?\nWill: Well, we did a little more than that.\nRoss: No-no! No-no. No-no.\nPhoebe: What?!

Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldnt go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)\nRoss: Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that ones not really our fault.\nRachel: Monica, how come you never told me this?!\nMonica: I thought it might be true.

Sorry about your tiney-wienie.\" (Will laughs.)\nRoss: Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasnt true?!\nRachel: Yes!\nWill: Could you also tell them Im skinny now?\nMonica: Oh! Me too!\nRoss: Well look-look Im not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!\nRachel: I dont care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Yknow what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.\nMonica: Thats not totally true.\nRachel: What?\nRoss: What?\nMonica: Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.\nRoss: (shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!\nMonica: Its true?!!\nRoss: No.\nRachel: Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!\n(Ross is at a loss for words.)\nWill: Mrs. Altman?

She didnt look 50!\nChandler: Did she look 16?\nRachel: Ohh, theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually.\nPhoebe: Oh! (They all look.) Wow!\nRoss: She didnt photograph well!\nChandler: Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!\nPhoebe: So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?\nRoss: I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace\nMonica: Didnt she walk with a cane?\nRoss: Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I cant believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Yknow what? (To Will) Im back in the club!\nWill: Yeah! (They high-five.)\nPhoebe: I wanna join!\nRachel: WhPhoebe!!\nPhoebe: Im sorry. Im sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didnt go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.\nRachel: All right, yknowFine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)\nMonica: All right, listen youre just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!\nRachel: Wow\nMonica: And Ross, if it werent for Rachels rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!\nRoss: As a romancer of the elderly.\nMonica: Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.\nRoss: The eyesdid still sparkle.\nMonica: Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-youve been through so much since then. And right now youve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Cant you just let this go?\nRachel: Shes right.\nRoss: Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.\nWill: Hold on! You got her pregnant?\nRoss: Yeah.\nWill: Are ya getting married?\nRoss: Nope.\nWill: So you knocked her up but youre not gonna marry her. Dude!
