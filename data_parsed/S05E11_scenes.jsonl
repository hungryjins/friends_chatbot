I can't pick out the rest of it.)\nRoss: Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, \"Wow, (To Chandler) I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before.\"\n(No one says anything.)\nChandler: Oh come on!!

They are sitting on the couch watching a movie. Ross is obviously hot.]\nRoss: (talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot? \nElizabeth Hornswoggle: No.\nRoss: Okay, it must just be me then.\n(He shifts on the couch and a ripping sound emanates from his lower regions, the sound reminds one of a brief explosion of gas. In other words, it sounds like he farted. She has a look of horrific wonderment, wondering \"Did he just fart?\")\nRoss: That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?\nElizabeth: No, go ahead.\nRoss: Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another word he heads into her bathroom.)\n[Cut to Elizabeth Hornswoggle's bathroom, Ross frantically pulls his shirt out and drops his pants. He exhales in sheer ecstasy as the coolness of the bathroom envelops his legs. He sits on the cast iron bathtub, again gasping in pleasure. He next grabs a magazine and starts to blow air on his exposed legs, but that doesn't work the way he wants it to. So he throws the magazine down, looks around for another idea, and finds one. He jumps up and hops to the sink. He turns on the water and starts to splash some on his legs, cooling them further.]\nRoss: (in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\nElizabeth: (yelling from outside) Hey, my favorite part is coming up!\nRoss: 'Kay!\n(He goes to pull up his pants, but can't seem to get them past his knees.
