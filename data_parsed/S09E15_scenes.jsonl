Rachel is in the kitchen    as Joey enters from his bedroom.]\nJoey: Morning, roomie!\nRachel: Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.\nJoey: Fifth day's a charm.\nRachel: Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're    making it so easy on me and Emma.\nJoey: Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,    and when does she stop crying all night?\n(Ross enters.)\nRoss: Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you    tonight?\nRachel: Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's    in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,    so...\nJoey: She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did    last night.\nRachel: Bye!\n(She leaves.)\nRoss: Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.\nJoey: No, hey, it's been great.\nRoss: Yeah?\nJoey: Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying    here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?    And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using    a breast pump...\nRoss: Yeah, that'll do it.\nJoey: Wow! So, how are you?\nRoss: I'm, I'm okay. \nJoey: Really?\nRoss: Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have    worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's    a divorce.\nJoey: Well, actually it...\nRoss: No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel    and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing    other people.\nJoey: Wow, really?\nRoss: Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good    for me...\nJoey: Sure, I know lots of girls. \nRoss: Yeah? Any names come to mind?\nJoey: Ooh, names?\nOpening credits.\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Joey is there as Phoebe    enters.]\nPhoebe: Hey.\nJoey: Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?\nPhoebe: What you got?\nJoey (checks the refrigerator): Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,    strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.\nPhoebe: Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart    from the great food.\nJoey: I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with    her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.\nPhoebe: Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.\nJoey: Why are they doing this?\nPhoebe: I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.\nJoey: You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in    here?\nPhoebe: I just wish they'd realise they should be together.\nJoey: I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,    that's where things were headed.\nPhoebe: I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have    more children.\nJoey: Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have    kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.\nPhoebe: You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's    out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.\nJoey: Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck!    But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.\nPhoebe: So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them    up with people?\nJoey: I know; that just pushes them further and further apart. \nPhoebe: Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel    up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.\nJoey: Ooh, that's a great plan! \nPhoebe: Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my \"plan-laugh.\" (A    maniacal laugh follows.)\n(They both start laughing really loudly.)\nJoey: Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...\n(He looks at his bedroom door, but he can't remember the    name of the girl.)\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. They're in the    kitchen as Rachel enters.]\nRachel: Hey!\nMonica: Hey!\nRachel: You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?\nChandler: See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?    I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll    excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.\nRachel: I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.\nMonica: Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?\nRachel: Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. \nMonica: Oh my god.\nChandler: Wow.\nRachel: Why? What's the big deal?\nMonica: Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...\nRachel: What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.\nChandler: Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I    mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!\nMonica: You want a job? Turn off \"Oprah,\" and send out a resume!\nRachel: So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?\nMonica: Oh, it's perfect.\nRachel: Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age.    Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around    the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And    oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody    murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!\nChandler (reading the newspaper): Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.\n[Scene: Central Perk. Joey is drinking coffee by the counter    as Phoebe enters.]\nPhoebe: Ooh, Joey. \nJoey: Hey.\nPhoebe: Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. \nJoey: All right! Who is he?\nPhoebe: Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold    down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.\nJoey (gives a thumbs up sign): Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got    for Ross.\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah.\n(They sit down on the couch.)\nJoey: She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher! \nPhoebe: A teacher?\nJoey: Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,    oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?\nPhoebe: Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey,    you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! \nJoey: Oh my god, you're right! \nPhoebe: Yeah.\nJoey: She even reads for pleasure!\nPhoebe: How do you even know a woman like that?\nJoey: What? I'm not allowed to know smart women? \nPhoebe: Joey.\nJoey: I met her at the library. I went in to pee.\nPhoebe: So now what do we do?\nJoey: Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,    and find him somebody else.\nPhoebe: What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the    date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets    stood up!\nJoey: Ooh...I hear that's bad. \nPhoebe: Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross    gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.\nJoey: Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like    Santa Claus.)\nPhoebe: It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... (Laughs the real \"plan-laugh.\")\n(They both start laughing again.)\nJoey: Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.\nPhoebe: No, I think we killed it.", "lines": [{"line_number": 1, "type": "narration", "text": "The One with the Mugging"}, {"line_number": 2, "type": "narration", "text": "Written by Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Plummer"}, {"line_number": 3, "type": "narration", "text": "Transcribed by Marita Bakken"}, {"line_number": 4, "type": "narration", "text": "[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.

No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.    Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!\n(Monica enters from their bedroom with a calendar.)\nMonica: Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until    the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.\nChandler: I don't do that.\n(Monica looks at him.)\nChandler: I'll try to stop.

Someone average height,    dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?\nWaiter: Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.\nRoss: Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.\nWaiter: Can I get you another glass of wine? \nRoss: Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home    alone.\nWaiter: Got stood up, huh?\nRoss: Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.\nWaiter: Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?\nRoss: No! \n(The waiter leaves.)\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.

I'm still ovulating.\nChandler: Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not. \nMonica: So, let's do this.\nChandler: I - I don't think I can.\nMonica: Come on.

Huh.

I mean, that's    just stupid.\n[Cut to outside Central Perk.]\nJoey: We're geniuses!
