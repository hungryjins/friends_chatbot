They're in the table!\nChandler: Well, that can't be good!\nJoey: We gotta get them out of there!\nChandler: How?\nJoey: Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?\nChandler: Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.\nJoey: Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.\nChandler: Joey, wait! The ball!\nJoey: Oh!\n(The ball rolls into one of the goals, and Chandler and Joey listen in horror as the ball makes its way inside the table. Finally, they can hear the birds again.)\nJoey: Oh God!

It's all glued together.\nJoey: Does that mean we have to bust it open?\nChandler: I don't know. Maybe.\nJoey: Oh my God!\nChandler: I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.\nJoey: All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. \"Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine.\"\nChandler: Did that movie ever get made?\nJoey: It did not.\n\n[Scene: The airport. Ross and Phoebe run in.]\nPhoebe: Ross, where are you going?\nRoss: To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?\nPhoebe: What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?\nRoss: Not since my cop-show got cancelled.\nPhoebe: You have to get a ticket to get past security.\nRoss: What? We're never gonna make it!\nPhoebe: Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!\n(They run to the ticket counter, but they get stuck behind a group of old people who are walking very slowly.)\nRoss: Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great. \n \n[Scene: The gate. Rachel walks up to the man at the gate and gives him  her passport.]\nGate attendant #1: (with a French accent) Madame, your passport please?\nRachel: Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!\nGate attendant #1: Your boarding pass, please.\nRachel: Oh.\n(She starts looking through her purse, but she can't find it.)\nRachel: Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.\nGate attendant #1: Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...\nRachel: I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.\nGate attendant #1: Madame, you must have your boarding pass..\nRachel: Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not  be having this problem. \n \n[Scene: The ticket-counter. Ross and Phoebe come running.]\nRoss: Hey, I need a ticket.\nPhoebe: Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?\nRoss: Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.\nPhoebe: We're on our honeymoon.\nTicket agent: And the destination?\nRoss: I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.\nPhoebe: I'm so lucky I married you.\n\n[Scene: The gate. Rachel is still searching for her boarding pass.]\nRachel: Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!\n(She runs up to the gate and the gate attendant standing there.)\nRachel: Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face!  You're a different person. \n \n[Scene: The ticket-counter. Ross and Phoebe have their tickets and start looking at the screens in order to find the gate.]\nRoss: Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?\nPhoebe: No, did we miss it?\nRoss: No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.\nPhoebe: Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.\n(Phoebe picks up her cell-phone and calls Monica. Monica is still packing in her apartment.)\nMonica: Hello.\nPhoebe: Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.\nRoss: What? Hey, hey, listen..\n(Monica is standing by the crib, and she's looking at her babies.)\nMonica: Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.\n(She holds the phone down to the twins.)\nRoss: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?\nMonica: Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.\nRoss: That's alright. Listen, listen.\nMonica: Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.\n(She holds down the phone to the twins again.)\nRoss: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?\nMonica: Isn't that cute?\nRoss: That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.\nMonica: Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.\nRoss: Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.\nMonica: That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.\nRoss: What?\nMonica: Newark airport. Why, where are you?\nRoss: JFK.\n(Ross sadly hangs up the phone, while Phoebe looks at him. Cut to Rachel at the gate. She gives her boarding pass to the gate attendant, and she goes onboard. The gate attendant closes the door  and locks it.) \n\n[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey and Chandler are still trying to get the birds out of the foosball-table.]\nJoey: (yelling) Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.\nChandler: And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.\n(Joey picks up a hammer and a crowbar and gets ready to destroy the table.)\nJoey: Okay. Here goes.\nChandler: What's the matter?\nJoey: I need to say goodbye to the table first.\nChandler: I understand.\nJoey: Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?\nChandler: I don't know. Except that, for one last time... (he touches the players as he says the following) Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.\nJoey: Okay, here we go. I can't do it.\nChandler: Well, I can't do it either.\n(Monica enters.)\nMonica: Hey! Did you find them?\nJoey: Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!\nChandler: We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!\nMonica: Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!\n(Monica grabs the hammer and the crowbar and gets ready to bust it  open.) \n \n[Scene: Phoebe's cab. She's driving faster than ever before.]\nRoss: Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!\n(Phoebe screams.)\nPhoebe: Well, I've never gone this fast before.\nRoss: Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.\nPhoebe: She's got her cell, you could call her.\nRoss: I am not doing this over the phone.\nPhoebe: You don't have any other choice!\n(She lets go of the steering wheel to get her cell-phone from her purse. Ross screams and reaches over in order to hold onto the wheel. Cut to the plane. Rachel is sitting in her seat when her cell-phone rings.)\nRachel: Hello?\nPhoebe: Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?\nRachel: Yeah.\nPhoebe: (To Ross) For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.\nRoss: Yay.\nPhoebe: Uh, Rach, hang on.\n(Phoebe tries to give her phone to Ross, but he won't take it. He mouths \"no.\")\nRachel: Phoebe? Is everything okay?\nPhoebe: Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.\nRachel: What? Why?\nPhoebe: I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.\nRachel: Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.\n(The passenger in the seat next to Rachel looks at her and seems a little nervous.)\nRachel: Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.\n(Rachel hangs up.)\nPassenger #1: Uhm, what was that?\nRachel: Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.\nPassenger #1: Okay, that doesn't sound good.\nRachel: I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.\nPassenger #1: But she is sometimes.\nRachel: Well...\n(The passenger stands up and gets his suitcase from the overhead compartment.)\nRachel: Wait, what are you doing?\nPassenger #1: Well, I can't take this plane now.\nAir stewardess: Excuse me, sir, where are you going?\nPassenger #1: I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.\nRachel: Could I get some peanuts?\nPassenger #2: What's wrong with the plane?\nAir stewardess: There's nothing wrong with the plane.\nPassenger #1: Yeah! The left Philange!\nAir stewardess: There is no Philange!\nPassenger #1: Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!\nPassenger #2: I'm not flying on it!\nAir stewardess: Ma'am, please sit down!\nPassenger #3: What's going on?\nPassenger #1: We're all getting off. There is no Philange!\n(Everybody walks out of the plane.)\nRachel: This is ridiculous! I...\n(She notices that everybody is leaving.)\nRachel: Yeah, okay.\n(Rachel leaves as well.)", "lines": [{"line_number": 1, "type": "narration", "text": "[Scene: Phoebe's cab.
