I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!\nRoss: (going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?\nEmily: You obviously can't keep away from her.\nRoss: Emily that's ridiculous.

Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.\nEmily: I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.\nRoss: Well, you can't know where I am all the time.

(He stands up and turns his back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back inside.)\nRoss: Well, I guess that's it.\nAll: Why, what happened?\nJoey: What happened? What happened?\nRoss: My marriage is over.\nAll: What?!\nMonica: Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.\nPhoebe: Here.
