Mmm-mmm.\n[She tastes it, and obviously hates it.]\nRTST: Yeah?\nMNCA: [disgusted, trying not to show it] I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.\nRTST: No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.\nMNCA: [still chewing] Mmm-mmm.\nRTST: But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.\nMNCA: Wow.\nRTST: Aren't you going to swallow that?\nMNCA: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.\nRTST: Yeah, isn't that great?\nMNCA: [with false enthusiasm] Mmm.\nRTST: Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes.

And, well, now, I love Mockolate.\nRTST: Really?\nMNCA: Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Phoebe are there. Monica is suggesting Mockolate recipes to Phoebe.]\nMNCA: How about Mockolate mousse?\nPHOE: It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.\nMNCA: Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?\nPHOE: What makes it pilgrim?\nMNCA: We'll put buckles on it.\n[Rachel enters.]\nRACH: Hey.\nPHOE: Hey.\nMNCA: Hey.\nRACH: Did uh, Ross call?\nMNCA: No, I'm sorry.\nRACH: Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, \"Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.\"\nPHOE: No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Ross is up in arms about the Rachel/Julie situation.]\nROSS: I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.\nCHAN: Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.\nJOEY: Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]\nCHAN: Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.\nJOEY: Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.\n[Ross gives him an insulted look.]\nCHAN: Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.\nROSS: Can't we just use a pen?\nCHAN: No, Amish boy.\nJOEY: Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.\nROSS: I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.\nJOEY: You could say that.\nROSS: And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.\nCHAN: Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?\nROSS: I don't know.\nJOEY: Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.\nCHAN: Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?\nROSS: [long pause] She's not Rachel.\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica has made food for Phoebe and Rachel to taste.]\nMNCA: Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.\n[Rachel takes a bite.]\nRACH: Oh my god.\nMNCA: Oh my god good?\nRACH: Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.\n[Rachel runs to the sink to spit it out.]\nPHOE: Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is on the phone with a computer hotline.]\nCHAN: I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?\n[Ross enters with a melancholy look.]\nJOEY: [to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?\nROSS: Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.\nCHAN: [in phone] So, Spock actually hugs his father?\n[Rachel enters.]\nRACH: Hey, do you guys have...[sees Ross, pauses]...hi.\nROSS: Hi.\nRACH: [sees his coat on] Where you goin'?\nROSS: I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.\nRACH: [dejected] Oh.\nROSS: No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.\nRACH: Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?\n[Joey is looking at Rachel, smiling, and gesturing his head towards Ross.]\nROSS: Well, uh.\nJOEY: He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.\nRACH: Really?\nROSS: Really. It's always been you, Rach.\n[Ross and Rachel hug.]\nRACH: Oh, god.\nJOEY/CHAN: Ohhh.\nRACH: Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.\nROSS: I know, I know, it's, it's almost...[turns around, sees Chandler and Joey] What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?\nRACH: Let me get my coat.\nROSS: Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.\n[Ross leaves.]\nRACH: Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. [notices Chandler's computer screen] What's that?\nCHAN: [nervous] What? Nothing.\n[Chandler closes up the laptop computer screen.]\nRACH: What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?\nCHAN: No, no, see? See? [the printer starts to run] Hey, it's printing. [to Joey, rattled] Hey, it's printing!\n[Chandler rips off the sheet of paper from the printer.]\nRACH: Well what is it? Let me see.\n[Ross walks back in, Rachel's coat in hand.]\nROSS: Hey, someone order a coat?\nRACH: Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.\nROSS: He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?\nCHAN: Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.\nRACH: And I'm in it? Then let me read it.\nCHAN, JOEY, ROSS: No!\nRACH: Come on.\nJOEY: Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?\n[Ross and Chandler stare angrily at Joey, who thinks he has come up with a good idea.]\nCHAN: [through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] \"It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end.\"\nROSS: That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.\nRACH: All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.\nROSS: No, you don't.\nRACH: All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. [Rachel grabs the paper and runs across the room, reading it to herself.]\nRACH: What is this? Ross, what is this?\nCHAN: Good luck.\n[Chandler and Joey leave quickly.]\nROSS: Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?\nRACH: Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?\nROSS: Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type \"little\", the idiot.\nRACH: Just a waitress?\nROSS: No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?\nRACH: Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!\n[Rachel leaves, and Ross follows her into the hall.]\nROSS: No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.\nRACH: She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.\n[She goes into her apartment and slams the door.]\nROSS: No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no!
