I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.\nPhoebe: Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.\nMike: No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and   partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm   there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?\nPhoebe: Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say \"Hell   yeah!\"\nMike: So we're doing it?\nPhoebe: Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together!

Chandler is   my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.\nMonica: (Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's   not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.\nJoey: Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always   a mistake.\nMonica: But Chandler lent you money!\nJoey: And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.\nMonica: Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.\nJoey: Oh...how much?\nMonica: Two thousand dollars?\nJoey: Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?\nMonica: Yeah...\nJoey: That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it.

I realised that this   place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff   to baby-proof the apartment.\nJoey: Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when   I was a kid it was like.. \"Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!\" or   er.. \"Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!\" Huh!\nMonica: Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?\nRachel: No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)\nJoey: You're gonna do it?\nRachel: Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?\nJoey: Oh, women can. You can't.\nRachel: Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?\nMonica: You're a pig. And you can't do this.\nRachel: Wha!? What!? Come on!

You know I've never lived with a guy before.\nMonica: Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal   your makeup. Unless they're playing \"This is what my sister would look   like\" (Looks at Chandler)\nChandler: Yeah.... she's not so cute.\nMike: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.\nPhoebe: Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.\nMike: Yes dear.\nMonica: Is that a bit you guys do?\nPhoebe: Uh huh...we're playing you two.\nMonica: We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!\nChandler: Yes dear.\nRoss: I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great!   I mean...I'm happy for you guys..\nMonica: I hear wedding bells.\nPhoebe: Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You   know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah.   Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that   highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house   in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send   Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.\nRoss: Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.\nPhoebe: I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a   soccer mom!\nMike: You ready to go?\nPhoebe: Yeah! You bet roomy!\nMonica: Don't you mean..groomy?\nMike: What are you talking about?\nPhoebe: Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have   us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously.   They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)\nPhoebe: China patterns!!!!!\n[Scene: Joey's apartment. Rachel is fiddling with the drawer.]\nRachel: This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater   sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. (Fiddles more)\n[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler sits on the couch. Joey sits at the round table]\nChandler: Hey Joe!\nJoey: Hey!\nChandler: Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything   about it.\nJoey: I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.\nChandler: And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica   and I are having a little financial trouble.\nJoey: Yeah, I know.\nChandler: What? What do you mean you know?\nJoey: Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and   the economy is bad.\nChandler: Oh! Right.\nJoey: (to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!\nChandler: Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.\nJoey: Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?\nChandler: Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins   writing a cheque)\nJoey: Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your   rent is. (shrugs)\nChandler: Oh ok.\nJoey: (To himself) I am on fire!\nChandler (Stands up and walks to Joey): Listen...this is really nice. Do you...   (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars?   Did Monica borrow money from you?\nJoey: Err... Kind of.\nChandler: I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?\nJoey: Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems,   it was for something for her.\nChandler: What?\nJoey: Something personal.\nChandler: What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she   wouldn't tell me about?\n(Woman with huge breasts cuts across them. Takes Joey's coffee)\nWoman: Excuse me.\nJoey: Boob job.\nMonica: I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!\nJoey: Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would   be crazy.\n[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe and Mike are packing stuff.]\nMike: Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little \"groomy\" joke.\nPhoebe: Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's   a play on the word roomy.\nMike: I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is...   maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not   expecting a proposal, right?\nPhoebe: Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where   it goes.\nMike: Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.\nPhoebe: What do you mean?\nMike: Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married   again.\nPhoebe: Oh. Wow.\nMike: It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of   lost faith in the whole idea.\nPhoebe: Was it really that bad?\nMike: At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....\nPhoebe: Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with   someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in   the ocean.\nMike: Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time   I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!\nPhoebe: But it's just...\nMike: Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.\nPhoebe: Oh!\nMike: I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together   isn't the best idea.\nPhoebe: No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make   sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start   changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!\nMike: Trust me, I will never...\nPhoebe: Yeah I get that.\n[Scene: Joey's apartment. Rachel is flipping through magazines. Handyman is   installing things. Monica enters.]\nRachel: Hi!\nMonica: So you gave in and decided to call someone?\nRachel: Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.\nHandyman: You're all set. (picks up his bag and starts to leave)\nRachel: Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh wait!   You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)\nHandyman: Thanks.....\n(Chandler enters)\nChandler: Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.\nRachel: Don't look at me I never get his jokes.\nMonica: Thank you?\nChandler: Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing   I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two...   single things.\nMonica: Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?\nChandler: No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.\nMonica: Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still   ok.\nChandler: Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.   I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more   specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.\nMonica: Okay...\nChandler: I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would   you? Don't answer that.\n(He leaves)\nRachel: Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.\nMonica: I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?\nRachel: I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?\nMonica: Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting   to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.\nRachel: No you really think that's what it is?\nMonica: You heard him! \"No bigger!\" \"You're perfect!\" \"Just   don't get any bigger!\" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling   coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.\nRachel: Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your   breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose   bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!\n[Scene:Ross's apartment. Phoebe is at the door.]\nPhoebe: Hi\nRoss: Hey!\nPhoebe: Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.\nRoss: Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for   all hanging out but to come to my home!\nPhoebe: No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.\nRoss: Why?\nPhoebe: Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.\nRoss: Never?\nPhoebe: Never.\nRoss: wow, are you still going to move in with him?\nPhoebe: I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really   that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything.   That marriage stinks!\nRoss: Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight   and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.\nPhoebe: That's not how you really feel is it?\nRoss: No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now   but I can't help it. I love marriage.\nPhoebe: Seriously? You divorce-o?\nRoss: If you have to call me name, I prefer \"Ross the Divorcer\".   It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love   to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before   she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.\nPhoebe: It's ok that's how you feel.\nRoss: But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have   so much fun and you love Mike.\nPhoebe: I do love Mike.\nRoss: Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and   you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!\nPhoebe: Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped.

(Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).\nMonica: What are you doing?\nChandler: Oh, you'll see my friend.\n[Time lapse, still Chandler and Monica's, but only Chandler is there. Enter Ross]\nRoss: (visibly upset) I'm dead?\nChandler: (faking sympathy) And so young.\nRoss: Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.\nChandler: Well, how you died was funny.\nRoss: Oh please, hit by a blimp?\nChandler: It kills over one americans every year.\nRoss: Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.\nChandler: You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!\nRoss: You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.\n[Scene: Phoebe's apartment]\nPhoebe: God, I wish Mike were here.\nMonica: Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?\n(Phoebe gives her a meaningful look)\nMonica: What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!\nPhoebe: I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.\nMonica: Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.\nPhoebe: Here.\nMonica: And now your cell.\nPhoebe: Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)\nMonica: This is your cellphone?\nPhoebe: Yes.\nMonica: This is your current cellphone?\nPhoebe: Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.\nMonica: Phoebe, where's your purse?\n(They run for Phoebe's purse, Phoebe gets there first and takes the cell. Monica tries to take it away from her)\nMonica: No, no! Give it to me!\nPhoebe: You can't have it.\nMonica: Give it to me!\nPhoebe: No (tucks it in her pants)\nMonica: I'll go in there.\nPhoebe: (disbelievingly) Oh yeah.\nMonica: Phoebe come here\n(they fight a little, the phone falls and Monica picks it up)\nMonica: Haha!\nPhoebe: Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's. Enter Joey]\nJoey: Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.\nRachel: Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.\nJoey: No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!\nRachel: Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.\nJoey: No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.\nRachel: Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail... \nJoey: Make the transfer! (She does so)\nRachel: Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?\nJoey: Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.\n(Emma cries)\nRachel: Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.\nJoey: But he's the same.\nRachel: Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.\nJoey: But he's the same.\nRachel: Joey, come on!\nJoey: He's the same!\n(they exchange Hugsy's).\nJoey: (to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!\n[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Enter Monica]\nMonica: Haha!\nPhoebe: You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.\nMonica: So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.\nPhoebe: Those are my shoes.\nMonica: Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.\nPhoebe: Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.\n(Someone knocks on the door)\nMonica: Who's that? (goes to open door)\nPhoebe: I ordered Chinese food.\n(Monica opens the door and Mike is standing at the doorway)\nPhoebe: What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?\nMonica: (To Mike) What are you doing here?\nMike: Phoebe called me.\nMonica: Phoebe!\nPhoebe: I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him.\nMonica: Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?\nPhoebe: There is a speakerphone on the base unit... \nMonica: Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!\nMike: Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see... \nMonica: (to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!\nMike: Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!\nMonica: Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.\nPhoebe: Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?\nMonica: Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).\nPhoebe: Sit down.\n(Phoebe and Mike sit next to each other)\nMonica: Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)\nMike: (to Phoebe) So how've you been?\nMonica: I've been pretty good!\nMike: (to Phoebe) You look really beautiful.\nPhoebe: Thanks, you look good too.\nMonica: Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!\nPhoebe: So how's the piano playing going?\nMike: Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.\nPhoebe: I've missed you too.\n(Silence)\nMonica: You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!\n[Scene: Ross's Apartment: Ross is doing something on his laptop when Chandler walks in]\nChandler: Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?\nRoss: uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)\nChandler: Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?\nRoss: Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little \"Ross is dead\" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?\nChandler: No, come on, you know that's not true.\nRoss: What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!\nChandler: Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.\nRoss: I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)\nChandler: Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.\nRoss: You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.\nChandler: Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.\nRoss: Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)\nChandler: Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?\nRoss: No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!\nChandler: Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !\nRoss: oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... \n[Scene: Joey's room: Joey is sitting on his bed reading DooL transcript when Rachel walks in]\nRachel: I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?\nJoey: Original or crappy?\nRachel: Original.\nJoey: No, sorry haven't seen him.\nRachel: Then what's that big lump under your covers?\nJoey: It's Monica, ok?\nRachel: That's not Monica!\nJoey: Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..\nRachel: (to herself) Oh God.\nJoey: ... she's being unreasonable!\nRachel: (yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!\nJoey: It does?\nRachel: Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.\nJoey: Really? She... she loves me?\nRachel: Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).\nJoey: Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him.\nRachel: Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!\nJoey: Look forget it forget it...  I can't do it.\nRachel: Are you gonna...  you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?\nJoey: How do you think I got him in the first place?", "lines": [{"line_number": 1, "type": "narration", "text": "[Scene: Monica and Chandler's.

Monica, Chandler, Rachel and Joey are in the kitchen]\nMonica: God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.\nChandler: Pie eating contest?\nMonica: Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something? \nChandler: No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.\nMonica: (smiling)That was a good day!\n(Suddenly Ross comes running into the apartment)\nRoss: (yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!\nMonica: I'm parked in a garage on Morton! \nRoss: (panting)They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.\nJoey: (sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?\nRachel: Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!\nJoey: (not yelling anymore)I was?\nRacel: Yes and you talked to her...\nJoey: I did?\nRachel: She dropped off a casserole?\nJoey: Oh yeah! The casserole lady.\nMonica: (to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?\nRoss: Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!\n(phone starts ringing and Chandler comes running out of the bathroom)\nChandler: (hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)\nRoss: (to Monica)Think he washed his hands?\nChandler: (into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?\nRachel: (to Monica)What's going on?\nMonica: Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.\nJoey: Ooh! Tough odds!\nRoss: (mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!\nJoey: (smiling)Look who's coming around!\nChandler: (still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.\nJoey: (excited)Did you get it?\nChandler: One of the slots got filled.\nJoey: (Still excited)By you!?\nChandler: Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.\nMonica: Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!\nChandler: Yeah I know.\nRachel: Well, there's two spots left right?\nChandler: Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.\n(Phoebe enters)\nPhoebe: (excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!\nMonica: Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.\nRoss: (mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!\nMonica: Alright, who wants to do it?\nPhoebe: Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!\nMonica: Ok, hey Rach?\nRachel: Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.\nJoey: I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.\n(Phoebe and Joey both grab one side of the wishbone)\nPhoebe: I hope I win!\nMonica: Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?\nJoey: I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!\nMonica: Right! .. but we \"know\" what you're wishing for!\nJoey: Can't really say!\nMonica: I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?\nJoey: (slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable with these questions!\nRachel, Chandler and Monica: Please, just do it!\nPhoebe: One, two, three!\n(they break the wishbone)\nJoey: I won, hey!\nRoss: You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thing gets hot!!\nRachel: You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?\nRoss: Uh, you're not gonna win.\nRachel: Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like \"oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape\" and you're gonna be all like \"oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai\"\nRoss: Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.\nChandler: I can see the headline now: \"Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm\".\nRoss: Why would I eat my own arm?\nChandler: Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.\nMonica: You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.\nRoss: Why?\nMonica: Because I know that you think the lottery is \"boohaki\" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.\nRoss: You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here (they kiss and hug)\nPhoebe: Get a room!\nChandler: Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?\nRoss: I don't know, probably just invest it.\nChandler: Ooh! Calm down ...\nJoey: Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? \nRoss: Oh, I'm sorry, did I say \"invest it\"? I meant \"be cool and piss it all away\" (Joey and Chandler pleased)\nJoey: Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!\nRachel: I don't really care about the Knicks.\nJoey: Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.\nRachel: (touched) You would do that? I never get picked!\nChandler: You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.\nJoey: You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!\nChandler: You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.\nRoss: (to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?\n(pause)\nChandler: (looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh ... Mommy?\nRoss: Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel \"Mommy\" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...\nRachel: I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.\nRoss: Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me \"Daddy\" too.\nPhoebe: Oooh, I like that, \"daddy\" (in a sexy tone)\nRoss: I ... I was just talking about Rachel.\nPhoebe: (still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?\nRoss: (tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't.\n(Phone rings, Chandler picks up)\nChandler: Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)\nJoey: Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?\nChandler: Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.\nMonica: Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!\nChandler: He's the boss's son.\nMonica: Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)\nRachel: Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.\nMonica: Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.\nRachel: Ooh, I have another idea!\nMonica: I'm sorry, idea time is over.\nPhoebe: Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?\nMonica: Yeah.\nChandler: What about the ones you have on the nightstand?\nMonica: There are no tickets on the nightstand!\nChandler: Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.\n(Rachel get suspicious)\nMonica: Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!\nChandler: Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!\nMonica: Chandler, sense the tone!!\n(Rachel comes out of their bedroom waving tickets)\nRachel: Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!\n(everyone's shocked)\nMonica: Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.\nPhoebe: Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.\nRoss: I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!\nMonica: Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!\nRoss: 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...\nJoey: I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?\nMonica: When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!\nJoey: (to Ross) I'll show you how.\nRachel: Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your \"special\" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?\nMonica: Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!\nRachel: Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?\nChandler: (to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...\nMonica: Ahhh!  (shocked)\nChandler: Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from Rachel)\nMonica: There's the man I married!!\nRachel: All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!\nMonica: Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!\nRachel: (surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!\nJoey: Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from Rachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!\nRoss: Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.\nPhoebe: Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)\nMonica: No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl) and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!\nJoey: Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)\nChandler: Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!\nRachel: Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)\nJoey: (in pain) Oh!\nPhoebe: (she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!\nRoss: (trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!\nPhoebe: (keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she stops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)\nRachel: Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.\nJoey: No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get jammed in the window)\nPhoebe: If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and makes as to drop the tickets on the street).\nEveryone: NO!!\nPhoebe: Don't come any closer!\nChandler: Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...\nPhoebe: No, what's more important, your friends or money?\nEveryone but Monica: Friends! \nMonica: Money! (they all look at her) Friends...\nPhoebe: Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?\nMonica: They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)...\nRoss: Monica!\nPhoebe: Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I broke your bowl.\nRoss: Go, go, go!!\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.]\n(All are returning from the street after picking up dropped lottery tickets)\nPhoebe: What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.\nMonica: Phoebe, we lost half of them.\nPhoebe: So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I  was gonna win, remember?\nRoss: Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...\nPhoebe: As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish.\nChandler: (looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!\nMonica: Oh, play them!\nChandler: Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)\nMessage: (Phoebe's voice) \"Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise\" (they all turns to look at Phoebe) \"I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo.\"\n(they all keep staring at Phoebe)\nPhoebe: Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.\nSecond message: \"Hey Chandler, it's Charlie\"\nChandler: This is..shhh!\nSecond Message: \"Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want.\"\nMonica: Oh God, I am so sorry honey...\nAll: Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!\nRachel: Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.\nChandler: Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?\nRachel: No, she was just much better at job than me!\nPhoebe: Guys, the drawing is about to start!\nRachel: (To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.\nRoss: Oh yeah, it's a good idea!\nMonica: (she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.\nChandler: Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. (pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?\nMonica: (she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants) 131! (they kiss)\nRoss: (on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel) Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to Rachel)\nRachel: Hi mum, put her back on!\nJoey: (sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.\nTV: \"Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53\"\nChandler: I got that!\nRoss: Oh, we have one too!!\nMonica: We are on a roll, people!!\nRoss: (calling Rachel) Come on!!\nRachel: (on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?\nTV: \"And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7\"\nMonica: Check your numbers! Make me rich!\nRachel: (she goes towards the others and she's very excited) Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!\nAll: Wow!\nJoey: And what did she say?\nRachel: She said \"gleba\"!! (she celebrates)\n(they just look at her for a moment; then they go back to checking the tickets)\nMonica: Make me rich!!\nRachel: (to Ross) Isn't that amazing?\nRoss: Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!\nRachel: Why-why aren't you more excited?\nRoss: Oh, Rach...oh...\"gleba\" is not a word.\nRachel: Oh, but of course it is!\nRoss: Okay, what does it mean?\nRachel: I don't know all the words.\nRoss: I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words (goes back to checking the tickets).\nRoss: Yes you did, gleba is a word!\nRoss: Ok, use it in a sentence.\nRachel: Ok... \"Emma just said gleba\"!\nRoss: It's not a word!\nRachel: Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goes and picks up the dictionary).\nRoss: Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....\n(Rachel glares at him)\nRachel: (searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.\n(Rachel shows Ross the definition on the dictionary, giving him a smug look; then she squints at the dictionary, as though unsure what to make out of it)\nRoss: She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head, very moved)\nJoey: (checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?\nChandler: No.\nPhoebe: I'm still looking through mine...\nMonica: Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!\n(phone rings)\nMonica: (answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.\nChandler: Ah, the \"I'm sorry I rejected you\" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the sofa) Hey, Steve.\nSteve: Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.\nChandler: Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!\nSteve: Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.\nChandler: Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?\nSteve: Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.\nChandler: Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow (hangs up).\n(he idly goes to the sofa, starts browsing a magazine. Everybody stares at him)\nChandler: What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.\nEverybody: (excited) Oh my God, congratulations!\nMonica: Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!\nChandler: Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?\nMonica: You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area)\nJoey: (to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job. \nChandler: Thanks, man.\nJoey: And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.\nChandler: Really? What?\nJoey: Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.\nChandler: (smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.\nJoey: Oh yeah.\nRachel: You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.\nRoss: Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.\nPhoebe: You guys, what was the Powerball number again?\nMonica and Ross: Seven.\nPhoebe: We won.\nRachel: What?\nPhoebe: We won!\nMonica: Let me see!\n(they all jump up excitedly and try to see the ticket)\nPhoebe: Don't tear it.\nRoss: Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.\nPhoebe: I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!\nChandler: Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.\nPhoebe: (still very excited) I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!\nRachel: So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?\nPhoebe: It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.\nMonica: You know what? You can have mine.\nChandler: Me too.\nJoey: Me too.\nRachel: Me too.\n(they all look at Ross)\nRoss: I guess if everybody else is...\nClosing credits", "lines": [{"line_number": 1, "type": "narration", "text": "[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.

For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through.\nChandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.\nRoss: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.\nChandler: Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?\nRoss: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!\nChandler: Yes, but the batteries...\n(Ross claps his hands)\nChandler: Thank you, thank you very much!\nRoss: Let's celebrate with some maple candy!\nChandler: No!\nRoss: At least tell me where you hid it.\n[Scene: Central Perk.

Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.\nRachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.\nMonica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?\nRachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.\nMonica: What do you think brought than on?\nRachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.\nMonica: A love scene? With who?\nRachel: Olivia.\nMonica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.\nRachel: So do you think that my dream means anything?\nMonica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.\nRachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...\nMonica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. \nRachel: You took the same class twice.\nMonica: It was hard!\n(Phoebe comes in)\nPhoebe: Hey!\nRachel and Monica: Hi.\nPhoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.\nMonica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.\nPhoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.\nPhoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).\n(silence)\nRachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...\nPhoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?\nRachel: Ok, we're still on that.\nMonica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough.\nPhoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?\nMonica: Tiny portions?\nPhoebe: Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it\"!\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.\nPhoebe: Well...it's not about quality.\nMonica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.\nPhoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.\nMonica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.\nPhoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?\nMonica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.\nPhoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini?\n[Scene: Hotel's reception]\nReceptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.\nChandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.\n(the receptions is puzzled.

(a few people raise their hands) Ha!\nMonica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).\nPhoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?\nMonica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)\nPhoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).\nMonica: Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)\nPhoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)\nMonica: I'm sorry...\nPhoebe: I'm sorry too... (they hug)\nMonica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner? \nPhoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free!

I really hope you don't think less of me.\nRoss: Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.\nCharlie: You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself.

Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.\nChandler: We really need to take those tests?\nMonica: Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year.

In a doctor's office?\nMonica: It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?\nChandler: (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!\nMonica: Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!\nChandler: Yeah, ok.

I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?\nRoss: (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.\nCharlie: Yeah, I guess that's true.\nRoss: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you.

Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.\nCharlie: If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.\nRachel: Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!\nJoey: (to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes...

Fortunately she has a very pretty face!\nMonica: Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!\nChandler: Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!\nDoctor Connelly: (entering) Hi there.\nChandler: Hi.\nMonica: Hi.\nDoctor Connelly: I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.\nMonica: Ok.\nDoctor Connelly: Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.\nChandler: Oh, DAMN IT!\n(Dr. Connelly glares at Chandler)\nMonica: Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.\nDoctor Connelly: Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.\nMonica: (long pause) Ok.\nDoctor Connelly: And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.\nChandler: Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!\n[Scene: Central Perk.

Kurts Baley?\nRoss: Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?\nJoey: Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!\nCharlie: So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?\nRoss: Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.\nCharlie: He's a pretty tough guy to impress.\nRoss: Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.\nRachel: Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?\nRoss: Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).\nChandler: (entering) Hey guys!\nRoss: Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.\nChandler: I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.\nRoss: It's in Barbados.\nChandler: But you come first!\nRachel: I'm there!\nCharlie: We'll see you, guys! (she goes)\nJoey: Bye.\nRachel: Bye, see ya. (she goes)\nChandler: (sitting down on the couch) Ok.\nJoey: All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?\nChandler: Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.\nRoss: So-so what did the doctor say?\nChandler: Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.\nJoey: So you're ruling out surrogacy?\nChandler: Yeah.\nJoey: So, I don't have to learn what that means?\nChandler: Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.\nJoey: Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?\nChandler: (stopping Joey) ah-ha!\nRoss: How do you feel about all this?\nChandler: I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.\nJoey: Come on Ross, be a good guy.

It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.\nSarah: I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.\nJoey: You don't own a TV?

I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.\nDavid: Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...\nChandler: Seriously, we're gonna do this?\nDavid: I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?\nChandler: Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?\nDavid: That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!\nChandler: What?\nDavid: Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.\nChandler: I didn't mean now...\nDavid: Why not? It's brilliant!

Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.\nChandler: I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) \"Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh...\" Spit it out, David!\nDavid: Uh, Phoebe, uh... (Chandler hits his own head) you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable.

So, to that end...\n(David produces the ring.

(Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!\nMonica: IT'S THE HUMIDITY!\nMike: Hi Phoebe.\nPhoebe: What are you, what are you doing here?\nMike: I have a question I need to ask you.\nDavid: I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.\nMike: Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.\nDavid: (annoyed) Ok, would you care for my seat as well?\nMike: Actually yeah, that'll be great.\nDavid: That's fair, you've had a long trip. (he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)\nMike: Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.\nDavid: Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.\nMike: Sorry David, but she really has to know this.\nDavid: Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.\nMonica: You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring...\nDavid: I have a ring.\nChandler: I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.\nDavid: Phoebe, will you marry me?\nPhoebe: (smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!\nDavid: Uhm... Ha ha!\nPhoebe: I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.\nMike: We can have any future you want.\n(they hold their hands, gazing at each other)\nDavid: Ok, I'm gonna take off.\nPhoebe: David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.\nDavid: Just so I know, if I had asked first...\nPhoebe: Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.\nDavid: Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! (he leaves)\nMike: Is it ok if I hug you now?\nPhoebe: Yes! (they hug)\nMonica: (to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's room. Monica and Chandler are in bed.]\nChandler: Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.\nMonica: I know (she snuggles to him)\n(Rachel runs in)\nRachel: (walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!\nChandler: I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!\n(Rachel opens the drapes)\nMonica: The sun is out!\nChandler: Hey! Remember when I had corneas?\nMonica: Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.\nChandler: Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.\nRachel: Nooo!\nMonica: Damn it!\nRoss: (from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!\n[Scene: Conference room. Ross is making his keynote speech]\nRoss: Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.\nRachel: Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!\nRoss: Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...\nChandler: (to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.\n(the paleontologist glares at Chandler)\nRoss: And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.\n(all the paleontologists laugh)\nChandler: (to the one sitting next to him) Really?\nRoss: But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...\n(Joey laughs)\nCharlie: What?\nJoey: He said \"erectus\"!\nCharlie: You're... you're kidding, right?\nJoey: No, he really said it.\nRoss: ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...\n(Rachel laughs)\nJoey: Erectus?\nRachel: Homo.\n[Scene: the hotel conference room]\nRoss: (concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!\n(Everybody stands up and applauds. Ross looks flattered and surprised. His friends and other members of the audience go to congratulate him)\nRoss: Oh, thanks guys!\nMan with a bow tie: (shaking hands with Ross) I thought... it was wonderful!\nRoss: Oh!\nMan with a bow tie: Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. (sighs) I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... (sighs again and smiles at Ross blissfully).\nRoss: (with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)\nRachel: All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?\nMonica: Yeah!\nRachel: (to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!\nRoss: Oh, thank you so much!\nJoey: Yeah, and so funny!\nRachel: Oh!\n(Rachel, Joey and Chandler pat him on his shoulders and walk off, together with Monica)\nRoss: (puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!\nMike: (popping by, smiling) You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!\n(Ross is dumbfounded to see Mike instead of David)\nMike: Oh... I'm back!\nRoss: (skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?\nPhoebe & Mike: Yeah! (they leave)\n(Ross goes towards Charlie, who's conversing with a fellow paleontologist, and touches her shoulder to get her attention)\nRoss: Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)\nCharlie: You were incredible!\nRoss: Yeah?\nCharlie: You blew them away!\nRoss: Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?\nCharlie: (smiling broadly) I was not!\nRoss: No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!\nCharlie: Oh my God! (pauses) I'm your groupie!\nRoss: (joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!\n(Ross giggles, but Charlie isn't amused at all.)\nRoss: (realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!", "lines": [{"line_number": 1, "type": "narration", "text": "[Scene: the Pharmacist convention.
