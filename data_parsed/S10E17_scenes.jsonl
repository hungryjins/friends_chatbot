The hospital knows you took two, right?\nMonica: Yes, it's twins!\nRoss: Oh my God.\nJoey: Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?\nMonica: (points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at the baby Chandler is holding) and that's a girl.\nChandler: Her name is Erica.\nRachel: Aw..\nJoey: Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.\nChandler: Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time   together.\nMonica: Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.\nRoss: Aw, he's gonna be so happy.\nPhoebe: Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s   newspaper guy, you know? \"Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow   this story wide open!\"\n(Chandler and Monica carry Erica and Jack over to the crib and put   them down carefully.)\nRachel: Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.\nMike: (To Phoebe) I want one.\nPhoebe: Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my   coat.\nMike: Seriously. Wanna make one of those?\nPhoebe: One? How about a whole bunch?\nMike: Really?\nPhoebe: Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the   Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda   dull.\nRachel: Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm   gonna miss my plane.\nMonica: I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.\n(They hug.)\nRachel: Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch   you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you   guys again. I love you all so much.\nMonica: I love you.\nChandler: I love you.\nMonica: Call us when you get there.\nRachel: I will. Ross, come here.\n(She pulls him over to the door.)\nRachel: I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.\nRoss: Neither will I.\n(They hug as Phoebe and Joey stare at the two of them.)\nRachel: Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.\n(She leaves.)\nPhoebe: So, you just let her go?\nRoss: Yeah.\nJoey: Hey, maybe that's for the best.\nRoss: Yeah?\nJoey: Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?\nPhoebe: But now she'll never know how he feels!\nJoey: Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so   long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. (Looks at   Phoebe) Right?\n(Phoebe nods.)\nJoey: Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get   over her.\nRoss: Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.\nJoey: What?\nRoss: I don't! I wanna be with her.\nJoey: Really?\nRoss: Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.\nJoey: Yeah, you are!\nPhoebe: Woo!\n(Monica and Chandler look shocked as Ross goes to leave.)\nPhoebe: Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!\nRoss: My coat...\nJoey: This is so cool!\nChandler: I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!\nJoey: But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to   say?\nRoss: I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least   I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.   Where - where is my coat?!\nPhoebe: You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to   the airport.\nRoss: Okay, guys, wish me luck.", "lines": [{"line_number": 1, "type": "narration", "text": "[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.
