Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross cant answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!\n(Ross hands Rachel back the newspaper, and she starts beating him with it again.)\nRoss: Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!\nRachel: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! \n(She throws the paper at him, misses and hits Monicas door, they all jump back at the sound.)\nRoss: Look, I didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up. \nRachel: We were on a break!\nRoss: That, for all I knew would, could last forever.

Listen someones gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, cause its like 9:15 now, and Im not there.\n[Cut to Living Room]\nRoss: Dont you realise none of this wouldve ever happened if I didnt think at that same moment you werent having sex with Mark?\nRachel: All right. Lets say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?\nRoss: (pause) Yes I would.\nRachel: Youd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?\nRoss: (less sure) Yes.\nRachel: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....\nRoss: (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because its, I mean its you.\n[Cut to Monica's bedroom]\nAll: Ohhhhh!\n[Later, Ross and Rachel are sitting in the kitchen.]\nRoss: What? Come on Rach, tell me what youre thinking?\nRachel: Im thinking, Im gonna order a pizza.\nRoss: Order a pizza like, I forgive you?\n(She turns around and glares at him, he turns away.)\n[Cut to Monica's bedroom]\nJoey: Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.\nPhoebe: We could eat the wax! Its organic.\nChandler: Oh great, food with hair on it.\nPhoebe: No, not the used wax.\nChandler: Because that would be crazy?\n[Cut to Living Room]\nRoss: Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because Im kinda hungry myself.\nRachel: Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, Id like to order a large pizza.\nRoss: No anchovies.\nRachel: With ah, extra anchovies.\nRoss: Thats okay, Ill just pick em off.\nRachel: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?\n[Cut to later, they are finishing up the pizza, theres one piece left.]\nRoss: You can have the last piece, if you want.\nRachel: Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.\n[Cut to Monica's bedroom, theyre all eating the wax, Chandler and Phoebe, dont like it. Joey tries some and makes a face like: Hey, thats not so bad.]\nPhoebe: Theyre gonna get through this, arent they?\nChandler: Yeah, come on, its Ross and Rachel, theyve got too.\nMonica: What if they dont?\n(Long pause.)\nJoey: You think I need a new walk?\nChandler: What?\nJoey: Well y'know, Ive been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a take notice walk.\nChandler: Are you actually saying these words?\n[Later, in the living room, Rachel is sitting on the couch, Ross is on the chair.]\nRoss: What, now youre not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-Im sorry, okay, Im sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought Id lost you, I didnt know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I dont cheat right, I, thats not me, Im not Joey!\n[Cut to Monica's bedroom]\nJoey: Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a come on look.) Yeah, okay.\nMonica: Hey. Its three in the morning. They dont know that Ive come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.\nPhoebe: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.\n[Cut to Living Room]\nRoss: Y'know what, y'know what, Im-Im not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. Youre the one that bailed on us. Youre the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!\nRachel: Thats....\nRoss: Thats what?!\nRachel: That is neither here nor there.\nRoss: Okay, well here we are. Now were in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And Im sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I cant. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just cant see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.\n(He kisses her on her shoulder, then her neck, then the side of her face, then just before he kisses her on the lips....)\nRachel: No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Dont! You cant just kiss me and think youre gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesnt work that way. It doesnt just make it better. Okay?\nRoss: Okay, okay, okay.\nRachel: (softly) I think you should go.\nRoss: What?\nRachel: (softly) I really think you need to go now.\nRoss: (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldnt work past it together...\nRachel: Yeah, what the hell did I know!\nRoss: Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....\nRachel: (crying) No. I cant, youre a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. Its just changed, everything. Forever.\n[We see the rest of them are now crying.]\nRoss: (crying) Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.\n(Pause)\nRachel: Then how come it is?\nClosing Credits\n[Scene: Monicas bedroom.]\nPhoebe: Theyve been quiet for a long time.\nJoey: Maybe she killed him?\nChandler: Lets go.\n[Cut to Living Room, Rachel is sleeping on the couch, Ross is gone, the rest of them can finally emerge from their cell. They all wave good bye, and start to walk quietly out, as Monica goes and puts a blanket on Rachel. Joey starts walking all hunched over and bobbing his shoulders as he goes.]\nChandler: (to Joey) Is that your new walk?\nJoey: (whispering) No, I really have to pee.\nEnd", "lines": [{"line_number": 1, "type": "narration", "text": "[Scene: Monicas Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are removing the rest of their wax strips.]"}, {"line_number": 2, "type": "dialogue", "speaker": "Monica", "text": "Ow!"}, {"line_number": 3, "type": "dialogue", "speaker": "Phoebe", "text": "Oh!!"}, {"line_number": 4, "type": "dialogue", "speaker": "Monica", "text": "Ow!!
