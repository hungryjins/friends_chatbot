And...(opens it)...it's a book!\nPhoebe: Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!\nJoey: (to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.\nMelanie: There is a little child inside this man!\nChandler: Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.\n(Rachel picks up the next gift.)\nRachel: Who's this from?\nChandler: Oh, that's Ross's. \nRachel: Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.\nPhoebe: Remembered what?\nRachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!\nChandler: Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)\nPhoebe: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.\nMonica: I can't believe he did this.\nChandler: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?\n(Everyone looks at him.
