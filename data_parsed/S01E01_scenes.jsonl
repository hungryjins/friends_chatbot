A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\n(They all stare, bemused.)\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\n[Time Lapse]\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. \nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\n[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]\nRoss: (mortified) Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today. \nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine! Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what? A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\n(Ross gestures his consent.)\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\n(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.)\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? \nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi. \n(They go to hug but Ross's umbrella opens. He sits back down defeated again. A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.)\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]\nMonica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. \nChandler: (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad? Decide!\nRoss: (in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.\nRachel: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! \n(The scene on TV has changed to show two women, one is holding her hair.)\nPhoebe: If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off. \nChandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. \nJoey: I say push her down the stairs. \nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\n(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)\nRachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. \nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\nRachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\n[Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\nJoey: What, like there's a rule or something?\n(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)\nChandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\nPaul: (over the intercom) It's, uh, it's Paul.\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!\nJoey: Who's Paul?\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\nMonica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\nMonica: Yes!\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\nRachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\nMonica: (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\nRoss: (choked voice) That'd be good...\nMonica: (horrified) Really?\nRoss: (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\nPhoebe: What does that mean?  Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)\n(There's a knock on the door and it's Paul.)\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\nChandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\nMonica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\nRoss: A wandering?\nMonica: Change! Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\n(Monica goes to change.)\nJoey: Hey, Paul!\nPaul: Yeah?\nJoey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\nMonica: (yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!\nRoss: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\nRachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\nRoss: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\nChandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it. \nRachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.\nRoss: Okay, sure.\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\nPhoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.\nCommercial Break", "lines": [{"line_number": 1, "type": "narration", "text": "[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]"}, {"line_number": 2, "type": "dialogue", "speaker": "Monica", "text": "There's nothing to tell!
