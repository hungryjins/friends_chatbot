I'd say 3 to 4. \nJoey: Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)\nRachel: Interesting. \nMonica: When it's your assistant, I would say never. \nJoey: All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. \nRachel: Huh. A moo-point? \nJoey: Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. \nRachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?\nMonica: Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-hes obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.  What he needs right now is for you to be his friend. \nRachel: You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. \nJoey: Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside. \n[Cut to the balcony, Tag is looking down while Rachel enters.]\nRachel: Hey! \nTag: Hey. \nRachel: How are you holding up? \nTag: Not bad. \nRachel: Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. \nTag: Thanks. \nRachel: So were you guys together a long time? \nTag: A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore. \nRachel: Now that she broke up with you? \nTag: Yeah. \nRachel: Yeah. Hmmmm. \nTag: It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling? \nRachel: NoYeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure itit has to work out. \nTag: Why? \nRachel: Because, uhit has to. \nTag: You have all the answers, don't you? \nRachel: Yeah, I know, I do.
