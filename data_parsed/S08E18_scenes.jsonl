Those two will never know what hit em. I cant wait. Theyre going to be crying so hard. Theyre going to be fighting for breath. \nChandler: Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could (Punches the air).\n(Cut to Rachel and Ross)\nRachel: And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.\nWoman: Blind?\nRachel: Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.\nAunt Lisa: Ill bet you looked beautiful\nRachel: Well, I dont know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.\nWoman: (To Ross) So, how did you propose?\nRachel: Oh yeah. Thats a great story.\nRoss: Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. Thats-thats where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower\nAunt Lisa: Oh that is so sweet!\nRachel: Shhh! I want to hear the rest!\nRoss: Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words \"Will you marry me?\"\n(Various oohs and ahhs)\nRachel: And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!\n(Cut to Phoebe and Joey)\nJoey: Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks.

Hes just too excited abouteverything. I mean Im all for living life, but this is the Gellers 35th anniversary. Okay? Lets call a spade a spade this party stinks.\nJoey: I know Im having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!\nPhoebe: Are you sure it wasnt an oyster?\nJoey: I guess it couldve been, I didnt really look at it. Yknow, I just wiped it on Chandlers coat and got the hell out of there.\nPhoebe: Hes just such a great guy Im so excited about him.\nJoey: Oh hey, you should be excited about him. Theres nothing wrong with him hes a good guy. \nPhoebe: You think?\nJoey: Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.\nPhoebe: Youre right. Youre right, hes just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him!

Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year Im going to do it.\n(Everyone sighs)\nMonica: No, no its going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably dont say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) When I look around this room, Im-Im saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she cant because shes dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember shes dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didnt see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits for people to cry, but doesnt get any tears.) You people are made of stone! Heres to mom and dad! Whatever!\nMrs. Geller: Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasnt it interesting, Jack?\nMr. Geller: (looking at the picture) Why dont I remember this dog?\nMrs. Geller: Ross, why dont you give us your toast now?\nRoss: Oh, no, Mom, its just Monica this year.\nMrs. Geller: Youre not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary\nRoss: No, of course, Um Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to sayon behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself.
